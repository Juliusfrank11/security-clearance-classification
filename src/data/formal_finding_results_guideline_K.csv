"Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b (later withdrawn), and 2.b. He admitted SOR ¶
2.a. His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He married in late 2012. He has an associate degree in
engineering  and  is  pursuing  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer, in  the defense  industry,  since  February  2018.  He needs  a  clearance for his
job. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 2007 to 2016, with a clearance, and
is  currently  in  the  Navy  Reserve  as  a  first  class  petty  officer  (E-6).  He  has  been
awarded four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. (Tr. 33-35, 55-57, 64, 84-
85; GE 1; AE B-H)
While on active duty in the Navy, Applicant was a crewman on Navy helicopters.
He deployed overseas in 2009, for about seven months; in 2010, for about six or seven
months;  and  in  2011,  for  about  eight  months.  He  had  no  overseas  deployments  after
that. (Tr. 36, 41, 55-57, 64-65)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  between  2010  and  2014,  Applicant  knowingly  divulged
classified  information  to  his  spouse,  without  authorization.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
denied the allegation, asserting that he never knowingly divulged classified information.
Applicant met his future wife in 2005. He testified that while they had met prior to
his  first  two  deployments  (2009  and  2010),  they  were  not  dating,  so  they  were  not  in
close communication at that time. (Tr. 42) They became a couple in 2011, and were in
close contact during his third deployment, in 2011. They married in late 2012. (Tr. 69-
70)
Applicant noted in his Answer that his future wife was concerned about his safety
when he went on missions. When they spoke, he told her about some of his duties while
on  missions,  because  she  knew  that  some  duties  he  had  to  perform  were  more
dangerous than others. (Answer; Tr. 73-74) He also told her if he had a “morning flight”
or a “night flight,” so she could know approximately when she might hear from him later
that day,  or at  all,  given  the  time  difference  with  the  United  States.  (Tr. 37-40,  44, 68,
73-74) He testified that other than the name of the mission, he never discussed specific
timeframes,  locations,  or  other  mission  particulars  with  his  wife,  such  as  “exact  flying
times.”  Rather  he  gave  “ballpark”  estimates.  (Tr.  40,  62)  Applicant  also  noted  in  his
Answer  that  he  should  have  been  more  careful  about  what  he  told  his  wife  about  his
work, as “others could have been listening,” including terrorists. (Answer)
Applicant left the Navy in November 2016. He then applied for a job with another
government  agency  (AGA).  The  job  application  process  included  a  polygraph
examination. (Tr. 45) Applicant testified that he was told not to do any research on how
to “beat a polygraph,” either on the Internet, or from movies or television. (Tr. 46-48, 80-
81) He said he was told “to go in there and, you know, just be myself, and that’s what I
did.” (Tr. 47)
Applicant denied getting information about polygraphs from movies and television
shows, either in preparation for the polygraph or earlier. He testified that he has been an
athlete  since  high  school.  He  said  that  through  both  athletic  and  military  training,  he
learned  how  to  “slow  and  deepen”  his  breaths  after  exercising  to  slow  his  heart  rate
down. (Tr. 82-83)
Applicant  reported  for  the  polygraph  in  October  2017.  (GE  2,  3,  4)  SOR  ¶  2.a
alleges that he “deliberately attempted to control his breathing in order to slow his heart
rate” during the polygraph. In his Answer, Applicant admitted  that he had tried to slow
down his heart rate. He said he “felt very nervous, like standing up in front of a crowd. I
was  attempting  to  slow  my  heartrate  down.  I  have  always  done  this  when  giving  a
speech.  It  felt  like  a  very  intense  situation  to  me.”  (Answer;  Tr.  63)  Applicant  similarly
testified that he was “a nervous wreck,” and he was “just trying to re-gather myself” and
“kind  of  calm  myself  down.”  (Tr.  44,  49,  62-63)  Applicant  denied  that  his  attempts  to
control his breathing by breathing deeper were an attempt to influence the outcome of
the polygraph. (Tr. 50)
Applicant  testified  that  after the polygraph,  the  examiner  told  him he  had  failed,
and asked him if he had “anything else” he wanted to add.  (Tr. 50-51, 76) He  said he
was  given  a  choice,  either  to  retake  the  polygraph  or  to  provide  a  sworn  statement.
Applicant  then  made  additional  disclosures,  detailed  in  a  contemporaneous  sworn
statement. (Tr. 52, 54, 76, 78-79)
In the sworn statement, Applicant said, “During the polygraph exam, I was trying
to  control  my  breathing  to  slow  my  heart  rate  down.  I  had held  back  information  that I
later told [the examiner], and included in this statement.” (GE 3 at 2)  Applicant stated
that he “felt I had to pass the poly exam, so [I] decided to try to control my heart rate,
which just caused me to need to breathe deeper during other questions. I let information
about  polygraph  exams  I  learned  from  movies  and  TV  shows  cloud  my  head.  The
purpose I was trying to control my breathing to pass the exam only.” [Sic] (GE 3 at 2)
Applicant also stated:
I  mentioned  classified  information  secret  level  to  my  wife,  during  my  3
deployments  to  [the  Middle  East].  Information  was  details  about  mission
specifications, trying to make her understand what I was doing, so she did
not  cause  additional  stress.  It  provided  a  decompression  for  me  as  well.
[It]  happened  during  the  years  2010-2014.  I  mentioned  and  was  stern
about her not repeating anything to anybody. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. 62)
Applicant  testified  that  when he  wrote  in  his  sworn  statement  that,  “I mentioned
classified information” to his wife, and then added the words “secret level” later. (Tr. 57-
58) My  viewing  of  GE  3  comports  with  this.  He  testified that  he  added  those  words  at
the prompting of the examiner. (Tr. 57-58) Applicant acknowledged during his testimony
that he wrote GE 3, signed it, and had a chance to review it before he did so. (Tr. 75)
Applicant also testified that he was unsure if the information he disclosed to his
future  wife  was  “classified”  or  “sensitive,”  and  at  one  point  said  the  information  might
have been “neither.” (Tr. 57-60, 72) Applicant also testified that other air crew members
shared similar information with their spouses or parents. (Tr. 40, 61) He said, “I strongly
believe that what I shared with my wife was not inappropriate or sensitive to the nature
of the mission.” (Tr. 72)
SOR ¶ 2.b, which Applicant denied, alleges that Applicant “withheld information”
during the polygraph. The language in SOR ¶ 2.b does not specify what information was
allegedly withheld. There was no testimony at the hearing from the polygraph examiner
that might have shed light on this allegation. There is only the sentence in GE 3 in which
Applicant  stated  that  he  “held  back  information  that  I  later  told  [the  examiner],  and
included in this statement.”
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  denied  withholding  information  from  the  examiner.  He
testified that he provided honest answers. (Tr. 53) He testified that he was not asked a
question  during  the  polygraph  that  would  have  led  him  to  truthfully  disclose  the
information  he  told  his  wife.  He  said  he  was  asked,  “Did  I  intentionally  or  knowingly
disclose  any  classified  information?  And  the  answer  is,  ‘no,  I  have  definitely  not  done
that.’” (Tr. 77)
The polygraph report from the AGA notes that Applicant “admitted to employing
countermeasures during the examination,” and noted that he “admitted to engaging in a
deliberate attempt to alter the natural outcome of the examination.” The “Exam Result”
is noted as “No Opinion – Countermeasures.” (GE 2) Applicant received a tentative job
offer from the AGA, but it was revoked following the polygraph. (Tr. 83)
Applicant’s former supervisor testified. He called Applicant “one of the best men
I’ve ever had work for me.” He said that Applicant’s work performance was outstanding
and  exemplary.  He  testified  that  Applicant  is  honest,  of  high  character,  is  very
trustworthy, and should be eligible for a clearance. (Tr. 23-33; AE A)
A  Navy  lieutenant  in  Applicant’s  unit  provided  a  reference  letter  in  which  he
attested to Applicant’s growth, talent, responsibility, maturity, professionalism, integrity,
intelligence, and “strong ethical compass.” He regards Applicant as a tremendous asset
to any government agency and deserving of the public’s trust. (AE A)
A
friend  and  co-worker  attested

professional and has excellent communications skills. (AE A)

is  smart,
",True
"Applicant is a 31-year-old single man. After finishing high school in 2008, he worked
as a painter, performing temporary jobs for various employers including his uncle. Later, he
returned to school, earning an associate’s degree in 2012, and a bachelor’s degree in
2015. He majored in the field of network security. (GE 1 at 11-12)  Since finishing college in
2015, he has worked for four successive companies in the information technology field.
Currently, he is a technician who conducts vulnerability scans on his company’s computers.
(Tr. 30)
Applicant  has  been  working  for  his  current  employer  since  2018.  He  is  highly
respected  on  the  job.  According  to  his  team  lead,  he  is  an  “honest,  trustworthy,
professional,  determined,  and  responsible  individual”  who  has  produced  exceptional
results. (AE E) While on the job, he has always handled sensitive information responsibly.
(AE C)
Applicant worked for the employer immediately preceding his current employer from
September 2016 to November 2018. According to his supervisor, he “approached every
situation, including numerous ones involving sensitive work and/or difficult clients, with a
positive attitude and very sound judgment.” (Answer, Attachment (Att.) 1 at 1) Moreover,
Applicant’s  work  was  particularly  integral  to  national  security  because  the  systems  on
which he was working “have been directly responsible for saving . . . [the] lives of law
enforcement officers and apprehending criminals . . .” (Answer, Att. A at 1)
Applicant’s tenure at the job that he began in January 2016 was troubled and led to
his termination in August 2016, as alleged in the SOR. Specifically, he made a number of
errors  leading  to  “system  failures,  work  stoppages,  additional  hours  of  labor  of  the
[information  technology]  team,  and  [loss  of]  company  money,”  (GE  5  at  1)  including,
improperly configuring a system firewall, “not paying attention to detail when ordering hard
drives,”  and  “failing  to  power  on  a  server,  causing  [the  staff]  to  waste  an  hour of  time
troubleshooting why [they] couldn’t connect to it.” (GE 5 at 1) His most serious oversight led
to the infection and disablement of the company’s network by a crypto-virus -- a problem
his supervisor, shortly after the episode, characterized as an “epidemic,” with significant,
ongoing negative repercussions. (Id.) After a comprehensive network scan, the information
technology team discovered that the source of the crypto-virus was an attachment that
Applicant had received on his computer. When asked whether he opened the attachment,
Applicant admitted previewing the message, acknowledging that this was the same as
opening  the  file.  (GE 5 at 1) When asked why he did not inform his supervisor of this
problem when it initially occurred, he responded that he was busy working on multiple tasks
and “just didn’t think anything of it.” (GE 5 at 1)
Applicant  was  consequently  placed  on  a  three-month  probation  for  poor  work
performance. (GE 5) Applicant’s supervisor, in a letter dated August 11, 2016, placing him
on probation, characterized Applicant as “a very loyal and hard worker” whose performance
had deteriorated over the three to four months before the crypto-virus episode.” (GE 5 at 1)
While  on  probation,  Applicant  inappropriately  disclosed  sensitive  personnel
information  of  company  employees,  including  salary and benefit information, upon the
request of another employee. (GE 3) Disgruntled because she suspected that she did not
receive as high of a raise as some coworkers, this employee, in mid-July of 2016, began
asking Applicant to provide her with access to her coworkers’ personnel files so that she
could  compare  her  raise  with  their  raises.  Applicant  initially  refused.  (Tr.  54)  She
subsequently asked him for this information multiple times over the following two weeks.
(Tr. 40)  He typically responded by either ignoring or deflecting her requests. (GE 4 at 4)
Approximately the last week of August, Applicant relented and provided this information as
requested.  (Tr.  39)  A  few  days  later,  Applicant’s  supervisor  discovered  e-mail
correspondence between Applicant and the disgruntled employee, leading him to suspect
Applicant’s  misconduct.  Subsequently,  he  confronted  Applicant,  who  admitted  the
misconduct, leading to his termination a few days later. (GE 2 at 2)
Applicant  admits  that  his  work  quality  had  begun  deteriorating,  as  noted  in  the
memo from his supervisor. The deterioration of his work performance coincided with the
pressure  of  caring  for  his  elderly  grandparents,  the  severe  illness  of  his  93-year-old
grandfather, whom Applicant was living with, in addition to  caring for, and the unexpected
death of his brother in June 2016, almost two years to the date of his mother’s death in
June 2014. (Tr. 31, 54; AE A) After his brother’s death Applicant did not “think straight.” (Tr.
31) He suffered from insomnia, cried every night, and did not eat for days at a time. (Tr. 32)
Applicant  was  further  distracted  because,  as  the  next  of  kin,  he  was  responsible  for
handling the funeral arrangements and disposing of his brother’s estate. (Tr. 15-16)
Applicant was still in a depressed state of mind when the coworker began pressuring
him to disclose the sensitive information. He recognizes that he should have reported this
pressure, and that he should not have provided her with the requested information, but
failed to do so because his judgment was clouded by his depression. Applicant attributes
his significantly better work performance on successive jobs since the termination to his
gradual recovery from the shock of his brother’s death and the pressure of caring for his
grandfather.
Applicant’s former supervisor at the job, from which Applicant was fired, wrote two
character reference letters for him. (AE A, AE F) He was aware of the issues in Applicant’s
life  that  were  causing  him  to  be  stressed and distracted at work.  (AE A) In the former
supervisor’s  initial  reference  letter,  he  characterized  Applicant  as  “stress[ed]  and
depressed to the point where he was acting on impulse rather than logic.” (AE A)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor  submitted  his  second  character  reference,  in  his
personal  capacity,  after  the  hearing  and  before  the  close  of  the  record.  (AE  F)  He
characterized  Applicant  as  “a  victim  of  a  plot  masterminded  by  a  vindictive  and
manipulative employee . . . upset about her performance review and raise.” Moreover, this
disgruntled employee was aware that Applicant was at a particularly vulnerable stage in his
life and took advantage of his “kindhearted ways and easygoing personality” to “specifically
target him to achieve her mischievous plot.” (AE F)
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations. His admissions in
his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  work-control  analyst  and  test  director  employed  by  a
defense  contractor since  March  2016.  He married  in  June  1998  and  has  two  children,
ages  16  and  14.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy  in  March  1998,  rose  to  the  rate  of
machinist’s  mate  chief  (pay  grade  E-7),  and  was  discharged  with  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions in February 2016. (GX 4.) He held a clearance until it was
suspended in March 2014. He does not have an active clearance.
In  1998,  while  Applicant  was  assigned  to  nuclear  “A”  school,  he  received
nonjudicial punishment for falsifying a study log for a friend to cover up the fact that the
friend missed two hours of study time. (GX 2 at 7.) Applicant was punished with 30 days
in correctional custody, after which he was allowed to resume his nuclear training. (Tr.
60.) This incident  was  not alleged  in  the  SOR,  but  Department  Counsel submitted  the
evidence in an effort to show a pattern of dishonest conduct.
In August 2012, Applicant was assigned to instructor duty at a nuclear submarine
training  command.  His  assignment  required  that  he  pass  the  engineering  watch
supervisor (EWS) examination. The command had two moored nuclear submarines that
had been converted into training facilities. Part of the training for new instructors was to
have  on-the-job  training  by  standing  watch on  one  of  the moored nuclear  submarines.
(Tr.  27.)  However,  when  Applicant  arrived  at  the  training  command,  both  of  the
converted  submarines  were  undergoing  repairs  and  could  not  be  used  for  on-the-job
training. (Tr. 27-28.)
In  early  December  2012,  Applicant  was  notified  that  he  was  scheduled  to  take
the  EWS  examination  later  in  the  month.  He  did  not  believe  he  was  ready  for  the
examination,  and  he  asked  for  an  extension,  which  was  denied.  (Tr.  28-30.)  He  was
concerned about his lack of on-the-job training. He was informed by a fellow chief petty
officer that the examination was very difficult to pass and that there was a study guide
for the examination  called  the  “pencil box.” The fellow  chief petty  officer told  Applicant
who  could  provide  the  “pencil  box”  and  how  many  “pencils”  he  would  need  for  his
examination. (Tr. 28-31.) The “pencil box” consisted of unauthorized electronic copies of
classified  examinations  and  answer  keys.  There  were  five  master  EWS  examinations,
given on a rotating basis every other week. The examinations were largely unchanged
since  2004  except  for  minor  revisions  to  reflect  changes  in  operating  procedures  or
existing equipment. The original copies of the examinations and answer keys contained
classified  information,  but  the  “pencil”  versions  did  not  have  classification  markings.
They  were  passed  around  via  unclassified  personal  email  accounts,  compact  discs,
thumb drives, and other non-secure means. Before taking the EWS examination, sailors
were  told  which  version  of  the  examination  they  would  be  taking  and  received  the
corresponding “pencil.” (GX 6 at 3.)
Applicant  testified  that  the  “pencils”  were  sent  to  his  personal  email  account,
because he knew that his receipt of the “pencils” before taking the examination was not
permitted.  (Tr.  68.)  He  kept  the  materials  in  his  barracks  room  without  properly
safeguarding them until he took the examination, and then he burned them. He admitted
at the hearing that he knew he should report the ongoing cheating scheme, but he did
not want to be “the person to ruin people’s careers.” (Tr. 73.)  He took the examination
and passed it. (GX 2 at 6.)
In  February  2014,  the  Navy  conducted  an  investigation  into  reports  of
widespread  cheating  on  the  EWS  examination  for  enlisted  sailors  assigned  to  nuclear
submarines.  The  investigator  concluded  that  the  cheating  began  at  some  time  before
2007.  The  investigator  recommended  “disciplinary  and  administrative  action”  for  25
sailors  who  provided  the  “pencil  files”  to  others,  13  sailors  who  cheated  on  their  own
EWS examinations, and 3 sailors who told others where to obtain the “pencil files.” (GX
6  at  18.)  The  names  of  the  participants  in  the  cheating  scheme  were  redacted  in  the
copy  of  the  report  of  investigation  submitted  in  evidence  (GX  6  at  8-10).  Hence,  the
record  does  not  reflect  whether  Applicant  was  identified  by  the  investigating  officer  as
one of the participants.
Shortly after the investigation of the EWS examination cheating was completed,
Applicant  was  on  liberty  when  his  master  chief  contacted  him  and  told  him  that
everyone who was engineering watch qualified was required to return to the command
for an “all chiefs” meeting. Shortly afterwards, a friend texted Applicant and alerted him
to  a  television  broadcast  about  the  EWS  examination  being  compromised.  Applicant
reported  early  for  the  “all  chiefs”  meeting  and  self-reported  his  involvement  in  the
cheating  to  his  master  chief. When  he  self-reported,  he  did  not  know  whether  he  had
been  identified  as  one  of the  cheaters.  (Tr. 33-35;  GX  2 at 6.) The  evidence  indicates
that Applicant had not seen the report of investigation when he told his master chief that
he was part of the problem, that he was embarrassed, and that he wanted to be part of
the solution. (Tr. 35.)
In March 2014, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment from his commander,
a  Navy  admiral,  for  three  violations  of  Article  92,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice
(UCMJ),  10  U.S.C.  §  892:  (1)  dereliction  of  duty  by  failing  to  safeguard  classified
information  by  wrongfully  downloading  it  onto  his  unclassified  personal  computer  and
printing it on an unclassified printer; (2) failing to obey a general order by failing to notify
his  security  manager  or  commanding  officer  upon  discovery  of  classified  information
being  lost  or  compromised;  and  (3)  dereliction  of  duty  by  cheating  on  his  EWS
examination.  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  pleaded  guilty  to  all  three  offenses
because he knew he was guilty. (Tr. 36-37.) His punishment was forfeiture of half of his
basic pay for two months. (GX 3.) Applicant testified that he did not exercise his right to
request trial by court-martial, because he believed he was wrong and needed to accept
his punishment. (Tr. 38.)
Applicant  also  incurred  several  collateral  consequences  of  his punishment.  The
admiral  who  imposed  punishment  also  suspended  Applicant’s  security  clearance.  (Tr.
44.)  Applicant’s  nuclear  specialty  pay  of  $550  per  month  was  terminated,  and  he  was
required  to  pay  back  $27,000  of  his  enlistment  bonus,  at  the  rate  of  $550  per  month.
When  Applicant  was  discharged,  he  still  owed  about  $12,000,  which  has  since  been
paid. (Tr. 46-49; GX 2 at 2.) He has calculated that his discharge two years before being
eligible for retirement cost him about $1.1 million in net retired pay after taxes. (AX E(3)
at 4-6; Tr. 55.
In  August  2014,  Applicant  appeared  before  a  board  convened  to  recommend
whether  he  should  be  administratively  separated  from  the  Navy  because  of  his
involvement  in  cheating  on  the  EWS  examinations.  The  three-member  board,
composed  of  a  lieutenant  commander,  a  lieutenant,  and  a  senior  chief  petty  officer,
unanimously  recommended  that  he  be  retained  in  the  Navy.  The  board found  that  the
material that Applicant downloaded and printed was not classified and that his cheating
on the examination was negligent rather than willful. Based on his record of outstanding
military service, the board unanimously recommended that he be retained in the Navy.
The  commanding officer who  convened  the administrative  board disagreed  with
the board’s findings of fact and recommendation. In November 2014, he initiated action
to  discharge  Applicant  “in  the  best  interest  of  the  service.”  In  his action  he  stated  that
Applicant admitted in a sworn statement that he tried unsuccessfully to pass the “pencil
box”  to  another  sailor.  (GX  7  at  3.)  However,  this  statement  was  erroneous,  because
Applicant’s  sworn  statement  made  no  mention  of  efforts  to  pass  the  “pencil  box”  to
another sailor. (GX 7 at 13-15.)
In  February  2016,  Applicant  was  discharged  with  a  general  discharge  under
honorable  conditions.  The  authority  approving  his  discharge  was  the  Secretary  of  the
Navy.  (GX  4.)  At  the  time  when  the  Secretary  approved  Applicant’s  administrative
discharge,  the  admiral  who  had  imposed  nonjudicial  punishment  had  been  promoted
and assigned to a position in which he could have advised the Secretary on the decision
to discharge Applicant and the characterization of his discharge. (Tr. 51-52.) Applicant
submitted no evidence to show that the admiral advised the Secretary or influenced his
decision,  but  his  attorney  argued  at  the  hearing  that  his  harsh  treatment  should  be
considered in determining whether he should have a security clearance. (Tr.101-03.)
During  Applicant’s  active  duty,  he  received  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Achievement  Medal  four  times,  the  Good  Conduct  Medal  five  times,  and  numerous
service  awards  and  qualification  badges.  (AX  A;  AX  C.)  He  received  solid  and
sometimes  outstanding  performance  evaluations  as  a  first  class  petty  officer,  the  last
two  rating  him  in  the  “early  promote” category,  the highest  recommendation.  His  three
performance  evaluations  as  a  chief  petty  officer,  covering  the  period  from  September
2013 to September 2015, rated him as “promotable,” the middle category.  (AX C at 7-
12.) The evaluation for September 2013 to September 2013 specifically mentioned the
nonjudicial punishment in March 2014. (AX C at 10.)
Applicant has received three performance evaluations since his employment by a
defense  contractor.  His  first  evaluation  for  calendar  year  2016  rated  him  as  meeting
standards.  His  evaluations  for  2017  and  2018  rated  him  as  exceeding  standards.  (AX
B.)
Applicant’s current supervisor for the past three years admires him for his natural
leadership  and  dedication  to  duty,  and  he  is  confident  that  there  is  “zero  chance”  of
recurrence.  He  noted  that  Applicant’s  duties  were  limited  by  the  lack  of  a  security
clearance,  but  that  he  “stepped  up  on  his  first  day”  and  worked  diligently,  performing
difficult,  strenuous,  and  dirty  jobs.  He  also  noted  that  Applicant  is  a  devoted  husband
and father, works long hours, and still finds time to coach youth sports and contribute to
his community. (AX D at 5.)
Applicant’s  wife  of  21  years,  his  mother,  several  close  friends,  several  co-
workers, and several former shipmates submitted statements  supporting reinstatement
of  his  clearance.  They  attested  to  his  devotion  to  his  family  and  his  community,
outstanding  leadership,  loyalty,  technical  competence,  integrity,  and  selflessness.  (AX
1-4, 7-18.)
A retired Navy captain who has known Applicant for almost 15 years testified at
the  administrative  discharge  board,  acknowledged  the  seriousness  of  Applicant’s
cheating,  and  testified  that  he  was  confident  that  Applicant  could  be  rehabilitated.  He
testified, “Knowing [Applicant], I would be extremely comfortable with him mentoring my
junior sailors and that this whole ordeal will give him a different perspective on life. . . . I
think he would value integrity and honesty even more.”  (GX 7 at 36.) The captain also
submitted  a  statement  at
to  Applicant’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness. (AX D at 17.)
the  hearing,  attesting
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  an  affidavit  declaring  that  he  has  been
involved in no misconduct or mishandling of protected information since his nonjudicial
punishment  in  March  2014.  He  included  a  statement  of  intent,  declaring  that  if  he  is
granted  a  security  clearance  and  involved  in  any  further  misconduct,  he  will  not
challenge any revocation of his clearance. (AX E at 1.)

"Applicant is 46 years old. He has been married to his wife since 1994, and they
have two children, aged 10 and 19. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1991
until 1995 when he was honorably discharged. Since 1996, he has worked as a defense
contractor  for  various  government  agencies  and  has  continuously  held  a  security
clearance. Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in 2009. (Tr. 8-9, 55-57, 107-109; GE
1; AE A; AE B; AE C)
At the time of the hearing, Applicant worked for a large government department as
a  senior  network  engineer  and  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance.  Prior  to  his  2015
periodic reinvestigation, Appellant held a top secret sensitive compartmented information
with  polygraph  security  clearance  (TS/SCI).  He  underwent  polygraph  examinations  for
two previous security clearance investigations. (Tr. 8-9, 103-104; GE 1; AE A)
The SOR alleged that between 2009 and 2015, Applicant hand drew diagrams of
a classified system which contained classified internet protocol (IP) addresses and site
locations and took them to his home. During this period, it is also alleged that Applicant
improperly emailed a diagram containing classified IP addresses and site locations via an
unclassified  network.  In  his  Answer  and  at  the  hearing,  Applicant  denied  purposely  or
inadvertently bringing classified hand-drawn diagrams containing classified IP addresses
and site locations to his home. Additionally, he denied  intentionally and unintentionally
emailing a diagram with classified IP addresses and site locations through an unclassified
network. (Answer; Tr. 57-58, 96, 105; AE A)
In 2009, Applicant started working as a senior network engineer contractor at an
agency within the DOD (Agency). At that time, Agency and its classified communication
system (CCS) were undergoing a transition from a legacy network to a new architecture.
CCS is the high-speed data, video, and voice network internet system for the intelligence
community  (IC)  and  Agency  is  the  caretaker  of  the  system.  Applicant  was  chosen  to
facilitate the transition for some of the other, more established, engineers. In order to do
this, he had to learn the old network and the new network, which took him about a year.
Part of the integration process included reducing 4000 IP addresses to roughly 100, and
there were no drawings of the old  or new networks for the aggregation. Drawings and
diagrams  are  used  by  network  engineers  to  encourage  stability,  redundancy,  and
resiliency on the CCS network. At that time, Applicant also worked as the liaison between
Agency and the IC agencies who used Agency’s CCS. (Answer; Tr. 58-61; AE A)
At  some  point,  Applicant  started  producing  templates  to  facilitate  the  changes
between the old and new networks. His supervisors approved him bringing unclassified
work home to work on substantive issues. At no point did his supervisors express concern
about this behavior. AE I and AE J are examples of unclassified work Applicant brought
to his home. (Answer; Tr. 62, 100-101; AE I; AE J)
On June 10, 2015, Applicant took his first of four polygraph examinations. The first
exam was for the five-year periodic reinvestigation for his TS/SCI security clearance. He
was admittedly nervous during the exam. Because the examiner determined that he had
a significant response to questions about sabotage, a second exam was conducted on
July  6,  2015.  No  opinion  was  provided  regarding  Applicant’s  response  to  questions
regarding intentionally mishandling classified information. (Tr. 58, 62-65; GE 2)
According  to  the  report,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  kept  working  papers  at  his
home, and they depicted internet technology infrastructure, schematics, communication
routes,  and  solutions  for  various  defense  and  IC  agencies.  Applicant  testified  that  he
disagreed with the polygrapher’s record of his statement, and he believed the examiner
did not understand the scope of his work. At the hearing, he explained that he maintained
classified and unclassified notebooks of his work. AE G and AE H are examples of work
he kept in his unclassified notebook, and they were reviewed by Agency. According to
Applicant, he tried to explain his work to the examiner and how he performed authorized
outages, matured the network, and terraformed or touched every site in every region to
prepare  for  the  infrastructure.  The  classified  diagrams  were  written  in  the  classified
notebook,  which  he  always  left  at  his  worksite.  Applicant  did  not  intend  to  give  the
impression that he brought classified materials to his home. (Answer; Tr. 64-68, 70, 90-
92, 98-99; GE 2)
At the conclusion of the second polygraph exam, the examiner referred the issues
to  the  investigations  division  and  insider  threat  program  within  Agency.  As  a  result,
Applicant’s  home  was  immediately  searched  by  Agency.  Applicant  accompanied  the
Agency  employees  to  his  home  and  did  not  have  access  to  his  home  between  the
interview and the search. At his home, he gave Agency employees access to his office,
computer,  and  documents.  Agency  seized  Applicant’s  personal  computer,  notebooks,
and  documents  related  to  his  work  at  Agency.  He  also  gave  Agency  access  to  his
personal email accounts and server. Two days after the search of his home, he voluntarily
brought to Agency an additional hard drive that was missed during the search. In early
September 2015, all of Applicant’s belongings were returned to him. It was determined
that  none  of  his  belongs  contained  classified  information.  Additionally,  Applicant  was
unaware of Agency finding any classified information on his unclassified computer and
email account. (Answer; Tr. 64-69, 71-76, 89-90, 93, 99-100, 102-103; GE 2; AE E; AE
G; AE H)
On  September  28,  2015,  Applicant  was  polygraphed  a  third  time.  Sometime
between the first examination in June 2015 and the third exam, he was required to take
his  annual  training  regarding  the  handling  of  classified  information.  The  polygraph
examination report indicated there were no opinions given regarding Applicant disclosing
classified information. (Tr. 51-52, 68, 72, 75-76l; GE 2)
Two  days  later,  Applicant  was  given  a  fourth  and  final  polygraph  examination.
According to the examination report, the examiner had no opinions regarding Applicant’s
responses to questions regarding the handling of classified information. However, during
the post-test  session, the examiner noted  that  Applicant  stated that  he  routinely  made
drawings of Agency’s CCS, took them to his home, and plugged the information into a
simulator for testing purposes. Between five and ten times, he failed to fully redact the IP
addresses. Applicant testified that this information  in the report is not accurate, and he
did not intend to give the impression that the diagrams were classified, because they were
not. (Tr. 76-77; GE 2)
During  the  post-test  discussions  following  the  fourth  polygraph,  Applicant
disclosed  that  on  one  occasion  in  2013,  he  inadvertently  left  a  folder  containing  IP
addresses and site locations on an Agency shuttle bus. The bus was used to transport
employees  from  Agency’s  headquarters  to  a  satellite  location  and  to  the  employee
parking lot. Several days later, he was able to find the folder on the bus, which remained
in its zippered pouch. When he examined the papers in the folder he realized he failed to
redact information. He was unsure if the information was classified, but it had the potential
to  be  classified.  He  did  not  report  this  incident  to  his  supervisor  or  to  the  appropriate
authorities  at  Agency  because  the  papers  never  left  the  Agency  compound,  and  he
believed  the  incident  was  minor.  This  is  the  one  and  only  time  that  Applicant  brought
documentation that might be considered classified out of the office. He also admitted at
the hearing that on four to five occasions, he may have failed to fully redact information,
but the documents never left his secure work location. (Answer; Tr. 77-83, 93-98)
Applicant  admitted  at  the  hearing  that  the  2013  bus  incident  was  potentially  a
security violation, but he has had no other security violations. If he were to inadvertently
violate  a  security  protocol  in  the  future,  Applicant  would  report  it  to  his  facility  security
officer and the appropriate government authorities. (Tr. 83, 105-106)
During  one  of  the  polygraph  interviews,  Applicant  remembered  that  he  sent  an
email to himself from his unclassified work account to his personal email that he thought
might contain sensitive or classified information. While working at Agency, he worked on
both unclassified and classified networks and computers. In response to the examiner’s
request,  he  produced the email.  At  the hearing,  he  explained  that the email  contained
nothing  sensitive  or  classified,  which  was  confirmed  in  one  of  his  letters  of
recommendation. (Tr. 87-90; AE F; AE L)
Following  one  of  his  polygraph  interviews,  Applicant  was  asked  to  sign  a
statement,  which  in  part,  indicated  he  had  taken  classified  materials  to  his  home.  He
refused to sign that statement as it was written. In October 2015, Applicant’s SCI access
was removed, and as a result, he could no longer work as a contractor for Agency. He
was not given the opportunity to further explain or address Agency’s concerns. (Tr. 49,
84-86; AE D)
Applicant’s witness (Witness), a government team leader at Agency, has worked
as  an  active  duty  military  member  and  a  federal  employee  since  1983.  He  previously
worked in computer engineering, but he has worked in network integration for over twenty
years. Witness has held a TS/SCI with polygraph security clearance since 1987. (Tr. 37-
39)
Witness and Applicant were coworkers between 2009 and 2015, when Applicant
was removed from Agency. They interacted daily, and Witness was Applicant’s team lead.
Applicant and Witness were both engineers who were responsible for ensuring that CCS
was operational and data and video was successfully transferred. (Tr. 39-41, 60-61)
Witness reviewed the SOR, GE 2, and AE F, and in his opinion Applicant did not
violate classification protocol when he brought hand-drawn diagrams of the CCS system
to his residence. The IP addresses alone were not classified, nor were the site locations,
but when the two elements are combined, they become classified under mosaic rules and
potential  compromise  results  in  a  security  incident.  According  to  Witness,  network
engineers  at  Agency  worked  at  their  homes  to  enhance  their  mission  by  studying  or
practicing routing protocols on their home computer or their home network. They did this
to run different scenarios. Applicant had a program at home in which he could run different
scenarios on how to use different routing protocols. “On those protocols the only thing
you need to do is input – you input IP addresses but you don’t necessarily have to put
your production or your classified IP addresses.” (Tr. 42-46, 51, 53-54; AE F)
Witness was never aware of Applicant violating any security protocols. He had no
concerns as to Applicant’s suitability to hold a security clearance and to protect classified
information. Applicant “had a great reputation with his coworkers and with management
because of his tenacity in building the network.” Witness described Applicant as honest,
intelligent, compassionate, hardworking, loyal, and possessing high integrity. (Tr. 46-51)
Applicant’s  three  letters  of  recommendation, were  written  by  former  and  current
co-workers.  They  all  reviewed  the  SOR  prior  to  submitting  their  letters  and  had  no
concerns  as  to  Applicant’s  suitability  to  have  access  to  classified  information.  They
described  Applicant  as  highly  trustworthy,  reliable,  and  knowledgeable.  Despite  the
issuance of the SOR, he remained in Agency leadership’s high esteem. (AE K; AE L; AE
M)
Applicant’s  annual  work  appraisals
through  December  2014,
demonstrate that he consistently received positive reviews.  During his years of military
service, Applicant received an Army Achievement Medal and a Good Conduct Medal. He
has also received multiple awards from his defense contractor employers, including his
employer at the time of the hearing, and the government agencies he supported.  (AE B;

",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a  and  1.b;  2.a  and  2.b;  and
3.a  through  3.g)  with  mitigating  and  explanatory  comments.  His  SOR  and  hearing
admissions are accepted herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  received  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  1984,  and  completed  master’s  degrees  in  1996  and  2009.  He
enlisted  in  the  Navy  in  1978,  and  was  discharged  in  1979  and  placed  in  the  Inactive
Reserve while attending college. He was commissioned as a Navy officer in 1984, and
served honorably until retired as a lieutenant commander in 2002. Applicant married his
wife in 1992. They have a daughter, age 24, and a son, age 22.
Applicant  has  been  working  for  federal  contractors  since  he  left  the  service  in
2002.  He  held a  top-secret  clearance  while  in  the  service.  His  clearance eligibility  has
been  continued  while  employed  with  federal  contractors.  He  seeks  the  continuation  of
his clearance, which is required for his employment with a federal contractor.
In  about  2010,  Applicant  applied  for  a  job  with  another  Government  agency
(Agency) that required him to participate in polygraph-assisted interviews. After a series
of  interviews,  Applicant  disclosed,  in  substance,  all  of  the  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR
allegations:
1. When he was about 13 years old, while babysitting for a friend of the family, he
touched,  and  on  a  second  occasion,  he  penetrated,  a  three-year-old  girl’s  vagina  with
his  finger  while  getting  aroused.  He  was  never  caught,  but  stopped  his  behavior
because he knew that what he was doing was wrong. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
2. Applicant started having uncomfortable feelings about his daughter - a strange
sexual attraction - when she started puberty. He was afraid that he would do something
stupid.  When  his  daughter  and  her  friends  were  about  13  years  old  (in  about  2009),
Applicant  began  sexually  fantasizing  about  his  daughter  and  her  friends  and
masturbated two to three times per month to those fantasies. Applicant denied he ever
touched  his  daughter  or  her  friends  inappropriately  or  that  he  acted  on  his  fantasies
(other than masturbating). (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant  told  the  Agency  investigator  that  he  stopped  his  sexual  fantasies  in
about  May  2011.  (GE  3)  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  having  the
sexual fantasies after his interview with the last investigator in January 2015. (Tr. 39)
After  his  2010-2011  interviews,  the  Agency  reported  Applicant’s  statements  to
the state’s social services agency who investigated the concern. Applicant’s family was
interviewed, and apparently he was cleared of sexual misconduct.
3. In about 1988, Applicant removed documents from a sensitive compartmented
information facility (SCIF) and took them to his home to study for an exam. Sometime
later,  he  returned  the  documents  to  the  SCIF.  He  also  took  submarine  qualifications
cards (marked confidential) as souvenirs. Applicant averred that at the time he took the
cards,  he  did  not  know  they  were  marked  confidential.  During  a  move  in  1999,  he
discovered they were marked confidential. Applicant did not return or properly dispose
of  the  cards  after  he  discovered  they  were  classified  confidential.  He  maintained
possession of the cards until 2010 when an Agency investigator asked him to surrender
them to him. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b)
4.  In  about  2009-2010,  Applicant  took  computer  equipment  home  without
authorization  from  his  federal  contractor  employer.  The  equipment  included,  in  part,  a
server with five drives, eight to ten keyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables,
three  laptops,  three  docking  stations,  and  cables  for  hard  drives.  Applicant  explained
that  he  was  asked  to  recycle  old  computer  equipment  under  his  control  before  the
company moved to another location. Part of his job was to create mock computer labs
for testing and studies. He did not recycle the equipment and took it home because he
believed he would need it to establish mock computer labs. Applicant did not asked for
authorization  to  take  the  equipment  home.  After  he  participated  in  four  Agency
interviews,  Applicant  returned  the  equipment  to  his  then  employer  to  recycle  it.
Applicant  donated  some  of  the  computer  equipment  he  wrongfully  appropriated  to  his
daughter’s school robotics lab.
5.  SOR  ¶  3.f  alleges  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted  and  failed  to  disclose
material  information  to  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  background
investigator. Applicant participated in an interview with an OPM investigator in January
2015.  During  the  interview,  he  was  asked  whether  he  had  sexual  fantasies  or
masturbation  habits  related  to  minors.  Applicant  admitted  to  having  fantasies  and  that
he  masturbated  to  pornography  of  young  women,  but  specifically  denied  any  sexual
fantasies  or  masturbating  habits  related  to  minors.  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to
disclose  to  the  OPM  investigator  all  the  information  he  disclosed  during  his  four
interviews  with  the  Agency  investigators  about  his  sexual  fantasies  and  masturbation
habits concerning his minor daughter and her friends as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a.
6.  SOR  ¶  3  g  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted  and  failed  to  disclose
material information to an OPM background investigator when he failed to disclose the
true extent of his unauthorized taking of computer equipment from his employer as set
forth in SOR ¶ 3.e. During his 2015 interview, Applicant admitted to, on one occasion,
taking home a computer shell (stripped of parts) except for its power supply. Applicant
deliberately  omitted  and  failed  to  disclose  that  he  had  taken  home,  at  least,  a  server
with  five  drives,  eight  to  ten  keyboards,  mice,  a  wireless  router,  network  cables,  three
laptops, three docking stations, and cables for hard drives.
When  questioned  about  his  omissions  and  failure  to  disclose  the  same
information he disclosed to Agency investigators in 2010-2011, Applicant stated he did
not see the need to disclose the information because he assumed the investigator had
read his statements to Agency investigators in 2010-2011.
",False
"Applicant is a 57-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
in  the  defense  industry.  He  also  held  a  security  clearance  during  previous  military
service.  He  is  employed  as  a  facility  clearance  officer  (FSO)  for  a  company  doing
business in the defense industry. He also has two part-time jobs that are not at issue in
this case.7 His formal education includes two associate’s degrees, a bachelor’s degree
awarded  in  2008,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration  in  2011.  His  first
marriage  ended  in  divorce  in  1990,  and  he  has  been  married  to  his  second  spouse
since 1990. He has eight adult children, none of whom live in his household.
Applicant comes from a military family. His father retired after 30 years of military
service. His wife is a retired servicemember too. Applicant served on active military duty
from  1982  until  he  retired  in  2005.  He  worked  in  the  fields  of  law  enforcement  and
security  services.  He  spent  the  last  five  years  working  in  industrial  information  and
personnel  security  where  he  was  also  responsible  for  protecting  classified  information
and equipment.8 He has a 20% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
He next worked as an FSO for a company during 2005-2011. He also had about eight
months as a self-employed security consultant in 2011. He began his employment as an
FSO and the contract program security office (CPSO) for his previous employer in July
2011. His employment ended in December 2015, the circumstances of which form the
basis for the SOR allegations.

6 Directive,  Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.20 requires authenticating  witnesses under certain circumstances, such
as when the documentary exhibit in question was not furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its
responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense to safeguard classified information
within industry.

Applicant has an excellent employment record and a good reputation in his line
of  work.  He  presented  substantial  documentary  evidence  establishing  his  honorable
military  service,  his  past  job  performance,  and  training  in  occupational  specialty.9  In
addition, he called eight witnesses all of whom vouched for his overall professionalism,
knowledge of the job, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. In particular, I was
especially impressed by the testimony of a witness who is employed as a special agent
working in the field of industrial security for the Defense Security Services. The witness
described Applicant’s work as a FSO as “very exceptional” with a lot of knowledge and
expertise.10
Turning  to  the  SOR  allegations,  two  matters  are  at  issue  stemming  from  his
employment  as  an  FSO,  which  ended  in  December  2015.  First,  the  SOR  alleges
Applicant  mishandled  company  proprietary  information  in  2015  when  he  transferred
over  1,600  files,  including  company  proprietary  information,  to  a  company-approved
external  hard  drive  without  authorization.  Second,  the  SOR  alleges  that  during  the
course  of  the  2015  investigation  into  the  above  matter,  he  was  asked  to  return  the
external  hard  drive  in  question,  but  intentionally  returned  another  external  hard  drive,
and  he  then  intentionally  and  without  authorization  destroyed  the  external  hard  drive
containing company proprietary information.
Applicant has provided varying accounts of his involvement in the 2015 incident.
In his January 2016 security clearance application, he said he left his job as an FSO in
December  2015  because  he  received  notice  on  November  30,  2015,  that  the  contract
was ending and he resigned on December 18, 2015.11 That is consistent with the layoff
notice  his  employer  provided  with  a  last  day  of  work  scheduled  for  February  5,  2016,
and  Applicant’s  December  3,  2015  letter  of  resignation  with  an  effective  date  of
December 18, 2015.12 He denied leaving the job under adverse circumstances.
But in response to Question 27 of the application, concerning use of information
technology  systems,  he  admitted  in  the  last  seven  years  illegally  or  without
authorization,  modifying,  destroying,  manipulating,  or  denying  others  access  to
information  residing  on  an  information  technology  system  or  attempted  to  do  the
same.13  He  then  provided  the  following  comments  and  explanation  concerning  his
affirmative answer to Question 27:
I  will  attempt  to  explain  my  answer  to  the  question  in  more  detail.  I  had
given  [employer]  my  two  week  notice  for  two  reasons,  one  was  [the]
contract  was  ending  in  February  2016,  and  two  because  I  was  offered

another  position  with  another  company.  During  that  two  week  period,  I
was  cleaning  out  my  files  and  paperwork,  and  also  transferring  some  of
my  accounts  to  other  [company]  employees  who  was  taking  over  my
positions.  On  Dec.  16,  2015,  I  was  asked  by  [employer]  to  turn  over  the
[external] hard drive I was downloading stuff to. I explained that the hard
drive had personal[ly] identifiable information (PII) on it. I turned a different
[external]  hard  drive  that  I  had  in my  possession  and  destroyed  the  hard
drive  that  had  PII  on  it.  I  destroyed  the  hard  drive  that  contained  my
personal  information  because  I  did  not  want  to  provide  my  personal
information
few
“prescreening  questionnaires”  for  another  program,  and  other  PII  data.
When  asked,  I  explained  that  I  knowingly  provided  my  [employer]  a
[external hard] drive that did not have personal data and that I destroyed
[the  external  hard]  drive  that  contained  PII.  I  was  then  informed  that  I
destroyed the hard drive without authorization.14

He  offered  additional  details  about  the  incident  in  response  to  another  question  as
follows:
[I]  destroyed  a  company  [external]  hard  drive [known  as  a] Passport  that
was  issued  to  me  sometime  in  2012.  I  had  personal  information  on  the
hard  drive  including  my  social  security  number  on  documents  and  other
personal items that I did not want to leave behind at the company.15
He further stated that he was relieved of duty with pay on December 16, 2015, and his
last day of work with the company was December 18, 2015.
Applicant  addressed  both  SOR  allegations  in  his  written  answer.  He  formally
denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  explained  that  he  transferred  files  from  a
company-approved  laptop  to  a  company-approved  external  hard  drive,  the  purpose  of
which was to “sanitize” the laptop of PII and other files he had compiled over the course
of four  years of  employment  with  the  company.16  He further explained that  his  actions
were  driven  by  the unusual  circumstance  of  the company  layoff  notice  he  received  on
December 15, 2015.
Concerning the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b, Applicant admitted providing an incorrect
external  hard  drive  and  intentionally  destroyed  the  external  hard  drive  in  question.  He
explained  that  he  was  acting  in  good  faith  to  ensure  that  he  did  not  improperly  or
inadvertently  release  PII,  such  as  social  security  numbers,  addresses,  identifications,
etc.  He  denied  knowing  if  any  company  proprietary  information  was  on  the  destroyed

hard drive, but said any such information was certainly backed-up on the shared drive at
work and easily accessible in that way.
In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  described  the  events  leading  up  to  his
decision to accept a new job and give two weeks’ notice to his then employer. He then
explained that he was confronted by a company official about downloading information
during a telephone call setup as a debriefing.17 He denied downloading information to a
personal  hard  drive  or  personal  USB  drives.18  He  also  denied  downloading  any
proprietary information.19 The call ended that day on December 16, and Applicant went
to  another location  to assist  the  work  there. While  there  he  received another  call from
the company to inform him that he was relieved from duty, and he was instructed to turn
over  his  company-owned  property  (e.g.,  badge,  keys,  laptop,  etc.).20  He  did  as
instructed and then got into his car and went home.
Applicant  destroyed  a  company-owned  external  hard  drive  (Passport  #1)  after
arriving home.21 He explained that he dismantled it with tools, put the parts in his grill,
and burned the parts with the assistance of lighter fluid. He explained that Passport #1
ended up at his home because he routinely carried it in a bag due to its sensitivity, and
the  bag  was  in  his  car  when  he  went  home  that  day.  He  agreed  that  Passport  #1
contained  sensitive  but  unclassified  information.  He  stated  that  as  far  as  he  knew
Passport #1 did not contain any company proprietary information. He stated that it did
not occur to him to turn in Passport #1 with the other equipment at the worksite because
he was surprised and in shock about being relieved from duty. Upon arriving home, he
realized  he  had  Passport  #1  and  was  concerned  about  it.  Knowing  Passport  #1
contained PII associated with other people, he decided to destroy the device. It did not
occur  to  him  at  the  time  to  call  his  supervisor  at  work  and  inform  them  about  his
possession  of  Passport  #1.  He  thinks  he  may  have  called  someone  at  work
subsequently  and  was  unable  to  talk  with  anyone,  but  he  does  not  remember  with
certainty.
The investigation by Applicant’s former employer substantiated the allegations of
damage  to  the  company’s  assets  and  unauthorized  downloads.22  Applicant  along  with
the  other  employees  who  received  layoff  notices  at  the  end  of  November  2015  were
placed  on  elevated  computer  and  e-mail  monitoring.  In  addition,  a  90-day  retroactive
download  report  was  generated  that  showed  Applicant  had  conducted  multiple
downloads  to  a  “possible  personal  external device,” since  September  2015,  with  more

than 1,600 files being moved, to include presumed personal files and company files that
likely  contained  company  proprietary
forms,
presentations, templates, and letters).
(e.g.,  security-related
information
Company  investigators  interviewed  Applicant  on  Wednesday,  December  16,
2015, which was a couple of days before Applicant’s final day of work on December 18.
Applicant  admitted  using  the  external  hard  drive  for  work-related  matters  but  not  for
personal  use.  When  confronted  that  computer  data  showed  that  personal  information
was  on  the  device,  Applicant  stated  he  did  not  know  what  they  were  talking  about.
Applicant  stated  that  it  was  a  company-purchased  device  that  was  given  to  him  by
another employee. He also stated that he used the device for work-related tasks while
at  the  site  or  on  business  travel  and  had  done  so  for  the  last  three  years.  Applicant
indicated that he would turn over the device to his manager before his departure from
the  company.  He  further  stated  that  he  did  not  have  any  classified  or  proprietary
information in his possession.
After  the  interview,  Applicant  was  placed  on  paid  administrative  leave  for  the
remaining  two  days  of  his  two-week-notice  period.  Applicant  turned  over  all  assigned
company  assets  to  security,  and Passport  #2  was  turned  over  to  the  site manager for
review.
The  company  determined  that  the  external  hard  drive  was  only  used  with
Applicant’s company-issued laptop. They also determined that the contents of Passport
#2 were different from the files displayed in the screenshots and it was not the device
Applicant used for downloads and during the monitoring period.
Applicant  was  contacted  again  concerning  Passport  #1.  He  stated  that  he  had
two  Passports  while  at  work,  but  he  withheld  this  information,  although  he  knew  the
company  investigator  wanted  to  obtain  Passport  #1.  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not
want  anyone  having  access  to  his  personal  information  on  Passport  #1.  He  further
stated that he brought Passport #1 to his home and destroyed it even though he knew
the  device  was  company  property  and  should  have  been  returned  to  the  company  for
review.  He  described  how  he  destroyed  the  device  by  dismantling  it  and  burning  the
parts  in  his  grill.  He  further  stated  that  he  did  not  have  any  classified  or  property
information in his possession, and he apologized for deceiving the company investigator
during the interview. The memorandum ends by noting that Applicant resigned in lieu of
termination on December 18, 2015.
Based on the matters set forth above, I hereby make the specific findings of fact:
1.  Applicant  mishandled  company  proprietary  information  in  2015  by
transferring  or  downloading  more  than  1,600  files,  including  company
propriety  information,  to  a  company-approved  external  hard  drive
(Passport #1) without authorization.
2.  Applicant  was  asked  to  return  the  external  hard  drive  (Passport  #1)
containing  the  company  proprietary  information  during  the  2015
company  investigation,  but  he  instead  returned  another  external  hard
drive (Passport #2) while at the same time retaining and destroying the
sought-after  device  (Passport  #1).  Destruction  of  the  device  was
intentional and without authorization from his then employer.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.23
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.24  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”25  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.26 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.27
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.28  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.29
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.30  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting

evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.31  An
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.32  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.33
Discussion
Although  the  SOR  alleges  three  different  security  guidelines,  Guidelines  K,  M,
and  E,  they  rely  on  the  same  set  of  facts  and  circumstances  as  set  forth  in  the  initial
paragraphs of the SOR at ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Given these circumstances, these matters will
be  addressed  together,  because  the  overall  decision  is  an  evaluation  of  Applicant’s
trustworthiness,  judgment,  reliability,  and  willingness  and  ability  to  safeguard  protect
classified or sensitive information, which are central matters for consideration under all
three security guidelines.
Under  Guidelines  K,  M,  and  E,  I  have  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions  as  most  pertinent  to  the facts and  circumstances  of  this  case:  AG  ¶¶  34(b)
and (g), AG ¶¶ 40(b) and (d), and AG ¶ 17(c). Likewise, under Guidelines K, M, and E, I
have  considered  the  following  mitigating  conditions  as  most  pertinent  to  the  facts  and
circumstances of this case: AG ¶ 35(a), AG ¶ 41(a), and AG ¶ 17(c). Having considered
the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances  in  light  of  the  pertinent  disqualifying  and
mitigating  conditions,  I  conclude  that  Applicant  did  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  to
mitigate the security concerns stemming from his intentional destruction of a company-
owned  external  hard  drive  to  which  he  had  transferred  or  moved  approximately  1,600
files, which included company propriety information, from his company-owned laptop in
advance  of  beginning  another  job  in  the  defense  industry.  The  sheer  number  of
downloaded files, reported to be more than 1,600, supports a conclusion Applicant was
transferring more than personal files.
My  main  concerns  and  doubts  in  this  case  are  twofold.  First,  Applicant  gave
varying  accounts  of  his  involvement  in  the  2015  incident.  Taken  as  a  whole,  his
accounts are at variance in important respects with his former employer’s account of the
2015  investigation  as  set  forth  in  the  January  2018  memorandum.  For  example,
according  to  the  January  2018  memorandum,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  purposely
provided  Passport  #2  instead  of  Passport  #1  to  company  officials.  He  said  essentially
the  same  thing  in  his  January  2016  security  clearance  application,  as  quoted  in  the
findings of fact. But in his hearing testimony he attributed his retention of Passport #1 to
oversight during the unexpected circumstance of being relieved from duty on December
31 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14.
32 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
33 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
16.  Given  the  varying  accounts,  I  am  uncertain  if  Applicant  is  giving  full,  frank,  and
truthful answers about his involvement in this matter.34
Second, Applicant did not conduct himself as an honest person on December 16
knowing that he still had Passport #1. An honest person would have made a reasonable
effort  to  return  Passport  #1  to  his  employer.  Return  of  the  device  could  have  been
accomplished  by  a  telephone  call  or  e-mail  to  his  supervisor  or  some  other  company
official;  getting  in  the  car  and  returning  the  device  to  his  employer’s  worksite;  or  by
mailing  or  delivery  of  the  device  to  the  employer  along  with  an  explanatory  note.
Applicant thinks he may have made a phone call without success, but his recollection is
uncertain. Further, an honest person would not have rushed to destroy Passport #1 on
the  same  day  he  was  placed  on  administrative  leave,  knowing  that  it  was  likely  the
company would be looking for it. Other than a single phone call, he did none of things
an  honest  person  would  have  done  if  they  had  inadvertently  or  mistakenly  retained
Passport #1. Instead, Applicant destroyed Passport #1 by dismantling it with tools and
burning the parts in his grill. Such conduct is suspicious and suggests he was trying to
hide  or  conceal  adverse  information.  Given  these  circumstances,  I  view  Applicant’s
transgressions as reflected herein to be serious misconduct.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  In  doing  so,  I
considered Applicant’s 23-plus years of honorable military service, his years of holding
a  security  clearance  in  the  military  and  while  working  in  the  defense  industry,  his
excellent  employment  record,  his  formal  education,  his  wealth  of  training  in  his
occupational  speciality,  and  the  highly  favorable  testimony  of  the  eight  witnesses.
Nevertheless,  his  favorable  evidence  does  not  outweigh  the  seriousness  of  his
misconduct.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  that  he  did  not  meet  his  ultimate  burden  of
persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him
eligibility for access to classified information.

"Applicant is a 63-year-old contracts manager for a defense contractor, employed
since 2014. He previously worked for another defense contractor from 2009 until he was
laid off in 2013. Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in 1980. He married in 1982 and
has two adult children. He held a DOD security clearance for 30 years before he was laid
off in 2013.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  E  that  Applicant  copied  company  proprietary
files  after  being  notified  that  he  was  selected  for  layoff.  When  confronted,  he  denied
having the files, until he admitted copying them after repeated questioning. Applicant also
falsified  material  facts  presented  to  a  Government  investigator  regarding  this  incident.
The incident described in SOR ¶ 1.a is cross-alleged under Guidelines K and M. In his
Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally copying the 661 files, and that it was
not his intent to do so. Rather, he intended to copy examples of his work for use in finding
another job, as he was in a “panic mode.” He noted that he had permission to work from
home  and  that  the  Government  investigator  was  “misleading.”  The  Government’s
evidence is sufficient to establish the SOR allegations.
On August 1, 2013, Applicant was notified that he was selected for layoff. He was
notified not to have contact with company customers during the transition. The company
began to monitor his work computer. Subsequently, Applicant removed three boxes from
the office and composed an email to the contracts team and copied the customer. On
Sunday, August 4, 2013, Applicant accessed the company computer system remotely,
deleted  certain  data  and  copied  661  files  to  his  personal  thumb  drive.  The  files  were
contract  related  information,  including  sensitive  company  financial  information  and
proprietary information including contracts, contract negotiation information, and attorney
work-product.
On August 8, 2013, Applicant met with company human resources and security
personnel.  He  signed  several  statements  affirming  that  he  was  not  in  possession  of
company proprietary information and electronic media. He was asked three times if he
had any company data in his possession, and Applicant denied it each time. The fourth
time, he admitted he may have information he copied for the transition. When the list of
661  files  was  presented  to  him,  he  admitted  he  had  copied  the  files  for  “reference”
purposes. He returned the thumb drive as directed.
When  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  2015,  Applicant  claimed  he
copied files with his supervisor’s permission over a period of time to a company thumb
drive and he was unaware of making any false statements to company personnel.
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he generally denied any wrongdoing with regard
to copying documents, and claimed the Government investigator was “misleading.” He
stated that he was focused on getting his job done, and when he lost use of a company
issued thumb drive, he used his personal thumb drive, and he did not remember that until
he was confronted with specifics. He apologized for his actions and stated that “what I did
after I lost my job was really stupid, and the only excuse I can offer is my state of mind at
the time.”
During the hearing in this case, Applicant admitted that he did things he should not
have,  including  taking  company  documents  that  were  useful  to  his  new  job  and  was
deceptive to the company. However, Applicant also testified that the he did not take files
for  an  improper  purpose  and  denied  having  company  proprietary  information.  When
questioned,  he  admitted  having  company
foreign  contracts  and  attorney-client
information. He also stated that he forgot the thumb drive was in his possession when
confronted by the company, and claimed that he copied documents routinely as part of
his work, but could not remember if he had a company laptop or a way to connect to the
company  computer  system  when  away  from  work.  He  has  not  sought  counseling  to
address this issue.

"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  70-year-old  senior  principal  engineering  fellow  with  a  defense
contractor. He and his spouse are naturalized U.S. citizens who met and married in the
United States. They had a daughter in 1977, who lived five years. They have two sets of
twin  daughters  born  in  1978  and  in  1986,  who  are  all  married  and  successful  college
graduates. Applicant and his spouse have nine grandchildren. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 15, 64, 111,
115-120.)
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  defense-contractor  employer  (company  X)  most
recently since March 1987. He previously worked for the company from 1979 to 1981.
He  has  been  at  his  current  job  location  since  2015.  (GE  1;  Tr.  64-65.)  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree earned in 1971, a master’s degree in electrical engineering awarded
in 1975, and a doctorate degree awarded in June 1979. Applicant was initially granted a
DOD security clearance in 1979. His clearance was renewed in April 1987 for his work
with company X, and he has held a Secret or Top Secret security clearance since then.
(GEs 1-4.) His security clearance eligibility was last renewed in May 2015, when he was
granted a Secret clearance. (GE 12.)
Applicant developed considerable technical expertise in his field during his more
than 30 years with his employer. He holds 21 U.S. patents with some work colleagues,
including  five  patents  granted  since  January  2016,  and  he  has  published  39  papers.

Agreement  (Standard  Form  312)  with  his  employer  on  December  7,  1998.  He  had
annual DOD security refresher briefings about his security responsibilities from at least
2006  to  as  recently  as  January  2,  2018,  as  required  by  his  employer,1  and  annual

Individuals  are  briefed  on  their  responsibility  to  report  to  security  any  issues  covered  by  the  13
adjudicative  standards,  including  use  of  information  technology  systems.  In  that  regard,  employees  are
informed to report any security violations that come to their attention, such as when “classified information
is  processed,  manipulated,  or  stored  on  a  computer  not  approved  for  classified  processing  (i.e.,  data
spill).”  Those  briefed  are  also  informed  of  the  National  Industrial  Security  Program  Operating  Manual
(NISPOM), and are specifically advised that classified information must be accessed only by individuals
with an appropriate level of clearance and a valid need-to-know; kept under the control or guarded by an
authorized person or stored in a locked security container, vault, secure room or secured area and not left
unattended; discussed in an area authorized for classified information or on a secure telephone; marked
appropriately;  transmitted  via  secure  communications  methods;  processed  on  a  computer  or  other
equipment  approved  by  the  government;  and  destroyed  by  approved  methods.  They  are  informed  that
employees  with  derivative  classification  authority  are  required  to  complete  Derivative  Classifier  training
every  two  years.  About  classified  information  systems  processing,  they  are  briefed  that  DOD  classified
information  may  only  be  processed  on  information  systems  approved  and  accredited  by  the  cognizant
security authority; that the use of personal laptops or other devices is prohibited; and that any  classified

also given closed-area briefings in April 2009, September 2013, and November 2016.3
He completed derivative classification briefings every two years between January 2014
and  January  2018,  which  was  required  by  his  employer.  (GEs  13,  17;  Tr.  67-68,  76.)
The information in the briefings he had over the years remained substantially the same
throughout his tenure at company X. (Tr. 68.) Applicant’s present desire and focus is to
mentor  younger  engineers  to  boost  his  employer’s  technical  contributions  to  the  U.S.
national  interest.  (Tr.  59.)  He  has  not  previously  had  his  security  clearance  eligibility
questioned  despite  some  security  violations  on  his record. The  salient  details  of  those
violations are as follows.
May 1995 violation (SOR ¶ 1.a)
While  working  as  a  principal  engineer  with  a  secret  clearance  in  May  1995,
Applicant created a six-page memorandum that was typed by his secretary in her office
using  a  dedicated  computer  that  was  not  cleared  for  classified  processing.  The
secretary  held  a  Secret  clearance.  The  document,  which  was  distributed  to  ten
employees  of  company  X,  was  thought  to  be  unclassified  by  Applicant  based  on  his
interpretation  of  the  SCG  dated  June  1992. Applicant  was  then  the  leading  analyst  on
the system, and he was asked to write a technical memorandum by the chief engineer,
who  planned  to  use  the  memorandum  to  explain  the  system  issue  to  a  customer.  (Tr.
20.)  On  review  of  the  memorandum  in  June  1995,  a  scientist  on  the  program  advised
Applicant that he thought the memorandum should be classified at the Secret level due
to the possibility that someone with sufficient knowledge could derive Secret information
from  the  technical  data  in  the  memorandum.  At  Applicant’s  direction,  his  secretary
information processing on a non-accredited system must be reported immediately to the facility security
officer or information systems security manager (ISSM). About computer data spills, which occurs when
classified  data  “is  accidentally  processed,  released  or  received  on  an  unclassified  PC  (or  associated
devices), network or voice mail,” cleared employees are informed about the possible damage caused by
data  spills,  costs,  and  consequences  for  the  offender.  Employees  are  specifically  advised  to  notify
security immediately in the case of a data spill and to know the SCG so as to avoid a data spill.
2 Available documentation of company X’s annual cybersecurity awareness training (GE 16) is dated May
2018.  All  users  of  a  classified  information  system  are  required  to  read  and  understand  the  company’s
security  plan  and  acknowledge  their  responsibilities.  Current  cybersecurity  awareness  training  informs
cleared  company  X  employees  that  all  media  and  systems  must  be  conspicuously  marked  with  the
classification level or labeled as unclassified, and that unclassified hardware cannot be used for classified
purposes  or  as  peripheral  equipment  on  a  classified  information  system  at  any  time.  Guidance  in
preventing  data  spills  reminds  the  briefed  employee  that  data  by  itself  maybe  unclassified  but  when
combined  with  other  data  may  become  classified  and  to  ask  a  subject  matter  expert  if  unclear.
Information  assurance  personnel  are  to  be  notified  when  there  is  a  classified  data  spill.  The  annual
cybersecurity  awareness  training  also  reminds  those  employees  who  anticipate  creating  derivatively
classified material about the requirement to take Derivative Classifier training every two years. Applicant
acknowledged that he received similar briefings before 2018. (Tr. 67.)
3 Available closed area-briefing documentation (GE 14) was published in 2016 and revised on  June 21,
2018.  Under  that  guidance,  closed  areas  are  established  to  protect  information  systems  processing
classified information and or classified information, which, due to their size and nature, cannot be stored
in  a  secured  container.  The  briefing  provides  that  closed  areas  are  generally  not  approved  for  open
storage of classified material.

employment  in  late  June  1995.  The  memorandum  was  taken  to  the  classified
publications  area  to  have  the  classification  marking  changed  from  unclassified  to
Secret. Applicant did not report the incident to his security office. (GE 3; Tr. 71-73.)
In  early  August  1995,  a  Defense  Investigative  Service  industrial  security
representative  (IS  representative)  conducted  an  inspection  in  the  publications  area  at
the facility. She discovered two copies of the memorandum in a classified container that
was  assigned  to  an  employee  with  a  Secret  clearance.  One  copy  was  marked  Secret
and  the  other  was  marked  unclassified.  At  the  request  of  the  IS  representative,  a
company  X  security  manager  initiated  an  administrative  inquiry  (AI)  to  determine  the
reason  for  the  difference  in  the  classification  of  the  memoranda.  During  the  inquiry,
Applicant  admitted  to  the  security  manager  that  he  had  his  then  secretary  type  the
memorandum  on  her  unclassified  computer.  He  marked  the  document  unclassified
based on his interpretation of the SCG, which he asserted did not identify the data as
classified.  The  security  manager  removed  the  affected  computer  and  brought  it  to  the
document control station. Security then contacted the employees who had received the
initial  memorandum.  All  of  the  employees  held  at  least  a  Secret  clearance.  Six  of  the
copies were recovered. The other four copies, which were not marked, were discarded
in  company  refuse.  In  reporting  his findings  of  the  AI  in  September  1995,  the  security
manager  opined  that  because  some  copies  of  the  document  had  been  discarded,  the
possibility  of  compromise  could  not  be  ruled  out.  However,  he  also  indicated  that  the
classified  data  that  could  have  been  derived  from  the  parameters  in  Applicant’s
memorandum was no longer classified as of mid-August 1995 based on the program’s
security  guide.  Applicant  was  found  culpable  for  the  violation.  He  was  issued  a
reprimand and re-briefed on his responsibility to promptly notify the security office of any
future similar incidents. (GE 3; Tr. 20-21, 74.)
In early October 1995, the IS representative informed the security manager that
she was concerned about the failure of employees to notify their security officials when
the  classification  issue  was  presented,  and  about  the  inadequacy  of  the  classification
review  process  before  a  document  is  released.  Noting  that  several  instances  of
classification  error  had  occurred  with  respect
the  particular  program,  she
recommended  that  the  employees  on  the  program  be  briefed  on  their  reporting
requirements  with  respect  to  classification  errors,  security  violations,  and  computer
security. The IS representative noted that Applicant had his memorandum reviewed as
required, and despite that fact, it was released as unclassified. Moreover, she noted that
none  of  the  ten  employees  contacted  by  the  secretary  to  retrieve  the  copies  reported
the incident to security personnel. The IS representative notified the Defense Industrial
Security Office of Applicant’s culpability for the violation. (GE 3.)
to
1998 violation (SOR ¶ 1.b)
The SOR alleges that Applicant caused a data spill by improperly emailing a file
containing  protected  information  via  an  unclassified  network  in  about  1998,  and  that
Applicant’s supervisor advised him that he had committed a security violation. Applicant
admitted  the  allegation  when  he  responded  to  the  SOR,  but  he  also  indicated  that  he
had  no  recall  of  the  incident.  The  allegation  may  well  stem  from  Applicant’s  voluntary
disclosure during his October 2013 subject interview that he had a committed a security
violation prior to the 2013 violation. He indicated that it occurred approximately 15 years
ago, which would have been 1998 as of his 2013 interview. He explained that he sent
an  email  to  a  chief  engineer,  which  included  a  Word  document  containing  classified
information, but there was no clear classification guidance. (GE 2.) Applicant appears to
have been discussing the 2006 violation, which involved the same named engineer. At
his  hearing,  Applicant  reiterated  that  he  had  no  recollection  of  any  security  incident  in
1998.  (Tr.  77.)  The  evidence  falls  short  of  establishing  that  Applicant  violated  security
practices and procedures in 1998.
March 2006 violation (SOR ¶ 1.c)
In  mid-March  2006,  Applicant  and  a  colleague  at  company  X  prepared  a
PowerPoint presentation for a symposium to be held in May 2006 on a design they had
created. Applicant marked up a hard copy of the presentation by changing one word on
the  title  page.  The  word  was  considered  classified  at  the  Secret  level.  Applicant’s
colleague made the change to an electronic copy of the PowerPoint presentation saved
on  his  laptop  before  emailing  the  updated  PowerPoint  presentation  to  Applicant.  Six
days  later,  Applicant  sent  emails  to  his  colleague  and  five  other  co-workers  with  the
contaminated  PowerPoint presentation attached.  One of  the  co-workers who  had  read
the  attachment  notified  the  program  security  manager  of  the  security  violation.  A
company X information systems security manager (ISSM) immediately conducted an AI.
Efforts  were  then  taken  to  delete  the  emails  and  wipe  the  contaminated  file  from  the
affected  computer  drives.  Email  server  backup  tapes  were  removed  and  taken  to
document control at another company X facility. Applicant had printed the document to
a  printer  in  another  building  and  had  stored  it  in  his  locked  office.  The  first  page  was
removed  and  turned  into  document  control.  As  required  by  ¶¶  1-303  and  8-100  of  the
NISPOM, the ISSM notified the Defense Security Service (DSS) of the results of the AI.
The  ISSM  concluded  that  compromise  had  occurred  because  Secret  information
resided  on  an  unclassified  email  server  and  on  unclassified  computers  for  ten  days.
Applicant  was  found  culpable  of  an  inadvertent  security  violation  for  transmitting  an
email  that  contained  classified  information.  He  was  issued  a  written  reprimand  per
company  X’s  security  standards  and  procedures  for  a  first  non-deliberate  security
violation in a 12-month period.4 He was advised that any further violation within the next
12  months  would  result  in  further  disciplinary  action  ranging  from  five  days  unpaid
suspension  to  termination  of  employment.  He  also  re-briefed  about  his  responsibilities
to be knowledgeable of the procedures for safeguarding classified information. After the
4  Under  its  security  enterprise  standard,  company  X  has  a  graduated  scale  of  disciplinary  action  for  a
failure  to  adhere  to  established  security  rules  and  regulations.  A  written  reprimand  is  issued  for  a  first
offense. For a second offense within a 12-month period, the discipline is suspension without pay for one
to five days. For a third offense within a 12-month period, the discipline is suspension without pay for six
to ten days up to and including employment termination. (GE 15.)
incident,  company  X  realized  that  the  work  on  the  specific  project  needed  to  be
completed in a closed area. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 81-83, 85.)
On August 12, 2009, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that he had been cited for
the  March  2006  security  violation  for  accidentally  transmitting  an  email  that  contained
information  that  was  not  classified  by  the  DOD  but  was  considered  classified
information  by  the  chief  engineer  on  the  project.  He  indicated  that  he  had  received  a
written  warning,  but  it  was  an  internal  violation.  When  interviewed  by  an  OPM
investigator in October 2013, Applicant explained about the incident that it was not clear
in  the  SCG  that  the  information  was  classified.  He  was  re-interviewed  in  November
2013 for further details about that incident and about the  security violation in 2013. He
explained about the 2006 incident that he sent the email not knowing that it contained
classified information. (GE 2.) Applicant testified at his hearing that the word he added
became  classified  in  context,  i.e.,  put  together  with  the  program  name.  Applicant  now
understands  that  he  should  have  had  the  document  reviewed  by  the  government
program officer before dissemination. He asserted he is currently following that practice.
(Tr. 80-81.)
April 2013 violation (SOR ¶ 1.d)5
On  March  18,  2013,  Applicant  sent  an  unsecure  email  with  an  attached
PowerPoint file containing data relating to three classified programs to four company X
employees  at  two  different  facilities.  The  next  day,  one  of  the  recipients,  an  electrical
engineering  manager  with  a  Top  Secret  clearance,  notified  company  X  security  that
there  was  a  possible  issue  with  an  email  received  from  Applicant.  On  notification,  the
attached file was reviewed for classification by the manager and a subject matter expert
with  a  Secret  clearance. The aggregation  of the  data  with  the  programs’ names made
the  PowerPoint  classified  to  the  Secret  level.  Cleanup  actions  were  taken,  including
delivering the email server and file-share backup tapes to document control. Applicant
showed his ISSM where the contaminated file was located on his hard drive, and it was
removed.  He  admitted  that  he  had  printed  the  document,  and  the  hard  drive  for  the
affected  printer  was  removed  for  destruction.  In  reporting  the  results  of  his  AI  to  the
DSS in accord with ¶¶ 1-303 and 8-100 of the NISPOM, a security manager concluded
that  a  loss  of  classified  information  was  assumed  based  on  the  fact  that  classified
information resided on an unsecured network for four days. Applicant was identified as
the  culpable  employee.  On  April  8,  2013,  he  was  issued  a  written  warning  for
inadvertently  publishing  information  that  was  determined  to  be  classified  onto
unclassified  systems.  Applicant  was  advised  that,  as  an  engineer  who  develops  or
formulates data in support of classified programs, it was vital for him to understand the
customer’s  SCG.  In  late  June  2017,  the  DOD CAF  was  notified of  Applicant’s  security
violation. (GEs 6-8; Tr. 83-84.) Applicant removed himself from working on the program
involving co-sites to minimize the risk of another data spill. (Tr. 86-87.)
5 The AI’s findings indicate that the violation occurred on March 18, 2013, and not in April 2013. (GE 6.)
During  his  October  2013  interview  with  an  OPM  investigator,  Applicant
volunteered  about  the  incident  that  he  had  performed  an  analysis  of  a  system  for  a
client  as  a  favor.  He  emailed  on  an  unclassified  network  two  files  consisting  of  a
PowerPoint  presentation  and  a  spreadsheet  to  some  company  X  employees  with
security  clearance.  He  stated  that  because  he  emailed  the  files  together,  they  were
considered  classified  by  aggregation.  Applicant  indicated  that  he  cooperated  with  the
company’s  investigation  and  acknowledged  in  writing  his  violation  of  a  security  policy.
Applicant  denied  receiving  any  remedial  security  education  as  a  result  of  the  incident.
He  kept  his  same  job  assignment  but  was  told  that  there  would  be  a  serious  penalty,
such  as  a  reduction  in  salary,  for  another  security  infraction.  When  re-interviewed  in
November  2013,  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  working  on  a  proposal  and  not  an
established program, so there was no closed room where he could handle the classified
data. He did not realize that by sending the two files at the same time, the data when
aggregated  became  classified.  Applicant  explained  to  an  OPM  investigator  in  August
2017 that the chief engineer had not properly briefed him about the project. He learned
from  the  incident  to  ask  those  working  on  the  project  to  review  information  for  its
classification  level  before  any  dissemination,  especially  for  a  proposal  that  does  not
have a SCG. Applicant also realized that he should have met with the chief engineer in
person to discuss the solution rather than send an email.  (GE 2.) Applicant asserts that
he could not have known that by aggregating the data about three programs it became
classified,  and  that  the  systems  engineer  in  charge  of  implementation  bears  some
responsibility for not giving him proper guidance about the classification issue.6 (Tr. 43-
44.)
August 2014 violation (SOR ¶ 1.e)
On August 6, 2014, Applicant sent an email with a PowerPoint attachment to two
work colleagues with Secret clearances. He sent a separate email containing a different
version  of  the  PowerPoint  file  to  a  recipient  of  the  first  email  and  to  two  additional
cleared colleagues. Under the SCG for the program at issue, the PowerPoint contained
data  classified at  the Secret  level. The  employee  that  received  the  two  emails  notified
his  security  manager,  and  corrective  action  was  taken  immediately  to  secure  printed
copies  of  the  PowerPoint  presentation  and  remove  and  wipe  the  affected  computers
and hard drives. Applicant was removed from the affected program and issued a written
warning  letter  in  which  he  was  advised  that  since  the  Secret  data  was  sent  over  the
Internet, it was deemed a compromise of classified information. As required by ¶¶ 1-303
and  8-100  of  the  NISPOM,  DSS  was  informed  of  the  violation  in  a  report  dated
September  4,  2014.  Based  on  the  fact  that  classified  information  resided  on  an
unsecured  network  from  August  5,  2014,  to  August  6,  2014,  a  company  X  security
manager advised the DSS that it must be assumed that a loss of classified information
occurred. Applicant was identified as the culpable individual. (GEs 9-10; Tr. 92-93.)
6 Applicant provided details of the April 2013 security incident when stating his concerns regarding GE 5,
which  is  the  written  warning  issued  to  him  for  a  non-deliberate  violation  in  March  2006.  He  provided
details  of  the  August  2014  security  incident  when  stating  his  concerns  about  GE  6,  which  is  his
employer’s findings of the April 2013 violation.
When  interviewed  by  an  OPM  investigator  in  August  2017,  Applicant  explained
that  he  created  a  scale  diagram  to  solve  a  problem  related  to  a  company  X  proposal.
Applicant  knew  that  the  numbers  on  the  side  of  the  scale  were  classified,  and  so  he
cropped  the  numbers  before  sending  a  graph  diagram  by  email  to  other  company  X
employees.  One  of  the  recipients  noticed  that  if  he  clicked  the  diagram,  the  picture
reverted to the previous version containing Secret information. Applicant acknowledged
he was at fault for the violation, which he attributed to rushing to send the solution while
working  on  three  projects  simultaneously.  There  was  no  SCG  for  Applicant  to  review
because  the  project  was  in  the  proposal  phase.  Applicant  now  understands  that  he
should  have  double-checked  the  diagram  before  emailing  it  and  that  he  should  have
sent the email via company X’s classified network. Applicant related that he has taken
corrective  action  to  preclude  a  recurrence  by  having  those  working  on  a  project  to
confirm  the  security  classification  level.  (GE  2.)  He  also  has  a  colleague  review  his
emails before sending them, and any attachments are now in PDF format. (Tr. 91-92.)
Applicant  attributes  the  violation  to  him  not  knowing  that  the  full  image  with  the
classified  information  was  recoverable.  He  asserts  that  company  X  should  have
provided  him  access  to  a  closed  area  to  process  the  classified  image.  (Tr. 45-46,  87-
90.)
November 2016 violation (SOR ¶ 1.f)
In response to a company X customer inquiry, Applicant prepared a PowerPoint
presentation diagnosing a technical issue for a deployed system. He included technical
specifications  that  were  classified  Confidential  under  the  program’s  SCG.  Applicant
obtained the technical specifications from an Excel spreadsheet provided to him in 2009
by a co-worker who then separated from company X in 2012.7 Applicant had saved the
spreadsheet  on  his  work  computer.  In  early  November  2016,  Applicant  emailed  the
PowerPoint presentation to an engineering fellow with a Secret clearance at his facility
and  to  two  company  X  employees  at  another  facility:  a  senior  principal  mechanical
engineer  with  a  Secret  clearance  who  reported  the  incident  to  her  ISSM  and  an
engineering  fellow  with  a  Top  Secret  clearance,  who  as  a  subject  matter  expert
confirmed the classification level. ISSMs at both facilities coordinated the collection and
cleanup  of  impacted  assets  in  accord  with  the  company’s  data  spill  response  guide.
Applicant was deemed responsible for the violation. In reporting the violation to the DSS
in  accord  with  ¶  1-303  of  the  NISPOM,  the  ISSM  at  Applicant’s  facility  concluded  that
classified  information  was  compromised  because  classified  information  had  been
included on an information system not approved for classified processing. (GEs 11-12.)
An  incident  report  was  filed  with  the  DOD  CAF  about  Applicant’s  security
violation. (GE 12.) In late November 2016, company X filed a subsequent incident report
notifying the DOD CAF that the November 2016 incident was Applicant’s fourth security
violation  since  2006.  In  December  2016,  the  company  notified  the  DOD  CAF  that  the
Excel  spreadsheet  containing  classified  specifications  had  resided  on  Applicant’s
7  There  is  no  indication  that  the  spreadsheet  was  conspicuously  marked  with  its  classification  level,
although the technical information was identified as classified in the program’s SCG.
unclassified  computer  since  2009,  and  the  contaminated  email  was  on  unclassified
email  servers  and  recipient  systems  for  approximately  24  hours.  Therefore,  it  was
determined that a loss of classified information had occurred. Applicant was counseled
that  it  was  critical  to  periodically  review  files  for  classified  information  before
dissemination. (GE 12.)
Applicant  explained  to  an  OPM  investigator  in  August  2017  that  his  supervisor
needed  him  to  troubleshoot  a  problem  on  an  emergency  basis.  Applicant  was  his
company’s subject matter expert on a component. Applicant created a PowerPoint slide
presentation outlining the steps he took to resolve the problem and sent it by email to
some company X employees. The following morning, he was told that he had included
“Secret”  information  in  the  PowerPoint  presentation.8  Applicant  explained  that  the
classified  information consisted  of an  item  that  was  deemed  classified  by  the project’s
chief  engineer.  Applicant  denied  knowing  that  the  new  number  was  classified.  He
asserted to company X security personnel that he should have been provided the SCG
because he was not privy to all of the classification specifications. Applicant detailed his
discipline  for  the  violation,  which  consisted  of  one  week  of  suspension  without  pay,
which he served in February 2017; inability for a pay increase in 2017; and a reduction
by half of his 2016 bonus. He was required to complete a security clearance application
(SF 86) immediately, which prompted the background investigation. (GE 2; Tr. 97-98.)
About  lessons  learned,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  should  have  asked  for  the
project’s SCG before working on the problem and emailing the PowerPoint. Regarding
corrective  actions  for  the  future,  he  expressed  his  intention  to  document  his  work  in
hardcopy first for the chief engineer to determine its classification level; to not send any
electronic copy without first having it reviewed; and to take more time to review the SCG
rather  than  rush  to  show  that  he  had  solved  a  problem.  Applicant  acknowledged  his
culpability  for  the  violation  in  that  he  was  negligent  in  not  reviewing  the  SCG  on  the
project.  He  stated  that  he  does  not  believe  classified  information  was  compromised
because  the  PowerPoint  was  sent  only  to  company  X  employees  and  the  information
stayed  within  company  X’s  computer  systems  network.  Applicant  displayed  remorse
over  his  violations  and  appeared  motivated  to  follow  proper  security  protocols  in  the
future  because  he  plans  on  retiring  in  the  next  few  years  and  does  not  want  to
jeopardize  his  career  or  future  retirement  benefits.  (GE  2.)  Applicant  accepts
responsibility for the violation. He had received the Excel spreadsheet in an unclassified
format and had not known that the Excel spreadsheet contained classified information.
(Tr. 48, 93-97.) After the incident, he obtained the SCG for the program so that he could
use it as guidance in performing maintenance to modernize the system. (Tr. 96.)
Applicant  attributes  all  of  his  security  violations  to  the  “gray  environment”  when
the projects were in the development stage, and the SCG was not clearly defined. He
lacked  any  deliberate  intention  to  compromise  classified  information,  which  was
disseminated  through  emails  to  company  X  employees  authorized  to  receive  the
information.  He  asserts  that  the  lead  system  engineers  on  the  projects  and  the  DOD
bear some responsibility for his security violations in that he should have been provided
8 The report of the AI indicates that the material was classified, but at the Confidential level. (GE 11.)
10
a  clear  and  updated  SCG.  He  submits  that  in  all  cases,  he  was  the  only  company  X
employee who fully understood the system’s operation, which placed pressure on him to
resolve the issues quickly and report progress to lead systems engineers outside of his
department. (Tr. 17-19, 42.)
Applicant  has  continued  to  provide  timely  and  effective  solutions  to  a  wide
assortment  of  complex  problems  for  his  employer.  He  is  highly  respected  by  systems
engineers  and  his  peers  at  work.  (AE  B.)  He  is  currently  working  on  a  program  to
improve  U.S.  defense  capability  and  plans  to  retire  in  two  years.  (Tr.  59,  61.)  He
mentors two employees who use his mathematical model to process classified data in a
closed  area.  (Tr.  71,  99-100.)  He  has  not  committed  any  security  violations  since
November 2016. (Tr. 98.)
Applicant  has  an  active  role  in  his  church’s  leadership.  He  became  an  elder  in
1999,  has  mentored  church  members  looking  for  employment,  and  is  involved  in  a
search  for  a  new  pastor.  He  and  his  spouse  counsel  couples  with  troubled  marriages
and parents with troubled children. (Tr. 16, 107, 111-112.)
One  of  Applicant’s  sons-in-law  testified  for  him.  This  son-in-law  is  a  licensed
attorney who has stayed at home to care for his and his spouse’s three children since
2010.  (Tr.  104.)  Based  on  his  review  of  the  SOR  and  discussions  with  Applicant,  he
believes the incidents occurred when Applicant was working on projects outside of his
group  where  he  did  not  fully  understand  the  rules.  He  considers Applicant  “an  upright
man  of  integrity  who  has  noble  intentions  and  always  tries  to  do  the  right  thing.”  (Tr.
106-107.)  Applicant has always been generous and fair with his time and attention. (Tr.
110-111.)
",False
"Applicant’s  admissions  are  included  in  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
review of the pleadings, hearing transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional
findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer
Science  in  February  1981.  He  has  never  served  in  the  military.  He  has  worked  as  an
Oracle  data  base  administrator  for  defense  contractors  since  2007.  He  first  married  in
1981, divorced in 1993, and married again in 2002. He has five children. (GX 1, e-QIP,
dated July 12, 2017)
Some  of  Applicant’s  work  was  performed  in  a  Special  Compartmented
Information  Facility  (SCIF).  The  SOR  alleges  three  incidents  of  Applicant  failing  to
properly secure the door to the SCIF as required by security procedures. There was no
compromise of classified information as a result of the incidents.
Applicant  had  shoulder  surgery  on  October  4,  2016.  He  was  in  pain  for  a  few
weeks  after  the  surgery,  not  sleeping  well,  and  taking  narcotic  pain  relievers.  He  was
cleared by his doctor to return to work by late October. 2016. He continued with physical
therapy until early spring 2017. (Tr. 11-14)
The first  incident  (SOR  1.a)  was on  November  29,  2016.  Applicant  admitted he
did  not properly  secure  the door  to  the  SCIF.  The required  procedure  was  for  the  last
person to use the SCIF in a day to lock the door by spinning the dial, setting the alarm,
and signing the security check sheet. If you were not the last person to use the SCIF in
a day, an individual just closed the door and spun the combinations locking dial. There
was no requirement to set the alarm or sign a security check sheet.
On  November  29,  2016,  Applicant  did  not  believe  he  was  the  last  person  that
would  use  the  SCIF  that  day.  However,  he  did  not  check  with  the  person  that  he
believed would use the SCIF after him to be assured that some would follow him to use
the SCIF. Applicant just closed the door and spun the dial. He did not set the alarm or
sign  the  check  sheet.  The  failure  to  set  the  alarm  and  sign  the  check  sheet  was
discovered later that evening by building security. Applicant was verbally counseled by
his supervisor and reread the security procedure guide. (Tr. 14-18)
The second incident occurred on January 9, 2017. Applicant’s wife called him at
about  1730, and  told him  that  there  was  an emergency  issue  with  one  of  his  children.
He left work immediately to assist his wife. The SCIF was not secured and the proper
procedures  were  not  followed.  Applicant  admitted  he  was  the  last  person  in  the  office
and should have ensured that the SCIF was secured. He stated he had no excuse and
he should have locked the SCIF. He received a written warning from his supervisor and
was required to receive extra training on open and close procedures. He also received
an additional security briefing. (Tr. 18-20)
The third incident happened on March 8, 2017. Applicant could not explain why
he  did  not  secure  the  facility  before  he  departed.  He  was  still  in  some  pain  and  was
receiving physical therapy. But he still had no idea why he did not properly secure the
facility that night. (Tr. 20-21)
Applicant  no  longer  works  on  a  contract  that  requires  him  to  open  and  close  a
SCIF. However, he has thought of procedures he can institute himself to assist him in
remembering to follow the proper procedures to open and close a facility in the future.
(Tr. 21-23)
Applicant’s  supervisor  at  the  time  of  the  three  incidents  testified  that  he  was
aware  that  Applicant  had  surgery  in  October  2016,  was  in  pain  for  a  time,  and  taking
medication.  Applicant  was  not  the  only  employee  that  had  an  issue  with  securing  the
SCIF. He was informed by building security when the SCIF was not properly locked. He
discussed  the  first  incident  with  Applicant  and  determined  that  he  did  not  need
additional training. He decided that their discussion would be sufficient counseling. He
had no concern at that time that there would be a similar incident. Applicant did not tell
him that his pain was a factor in his failure to secure the facility.
On  the  second  incident,  He  gave  Applicant  a  written  reprimand.  He  did  not
remember  any  reason  Applicant  provided  for  his  failure  the  follow  procedures.  On  the
third  incident,  Applicant  could  not  provide  a  reason  for  his  failure  to  secure  the  room.
Applicant  was  upset  that  he  did  not  lock  the  room.  As  a  result  of  this  incident,  the
witness  removed  Applicant’s  access  to  the  room.  There  have  been  no  other  security
incidents involving Applicant either before or after these events. (Tr. 30-38)
One  of  Applicant’s  coworkers  testified  that  he  has  worked  with  Applicant  since
2015.  He  knows  that  Applicant  had  surgery  in  October  2016.  At  the  time,  Applicant
looked like he was in pain and had limited sleep. The witness was only told that there
were lapses in properly securing the SCIF. He also knew that Applicant was upset when
he realized that he had not properly security the SCIF. At present, Applicant is working
on  a  non-secure  program  and  does  not  require  access  to  classified  information.  He  is
not aware of any other security breach incidents involving Applicant. (Tr. 39-43)
Applicant’s  current  supervisor  testified  that  he  has  worked  with  Applicant  for
about 18 months. The project they are working does not require them to have open and
closing privileges. Applicant is security aware and careful with his work product. His skill
set is very good. (Tr. 43-47)

"Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  system  administrator,  senior  software  engineer,  and
information  systems  security  officer  for  a  defense  contractor,  employed  since  2008.
Applicant married in 1980 and has two adult children. He received a bachelor’s degree in
1991.  He  testified  that  he  has  held  a  DOD  top  secret  security  clearance  for  nearly  30
years.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  K  (Handling  Protected  Information),  that
Applicant  committed  security  violations  in  2015  by  not  properly  securing  classified
information;  and  in  2016  by  improperly  using  his  system  administrator  logins  and
passwords, in violation of his privileged user agreement. The SOR also alleges that in
2017,  his  employer  relieved  him  of  his  information  system  security  officer  and  system
administrator duties  and access  to  system accounts following  several inspection  items
from  2016  to  2017  that  showed  repeated  failures  to  comply  with  system  security
requirements, policies, and procedures. The incidents described in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c
were cross-alleged under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology). In his Answer to
the SOR, Applicant  admitted the two incidents  in 2015 and 2016, but denied the 2017
allegation  and  the  cross-allegation  under  Guideline  M.  The  Government’s  evidence  is
sufficient to establish the SOR allegations.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  failed  to  properly  secure  classified  information.
Applicant was appointed the information systems security officer (ISSO) by his employer
in January 2015 after the previous ISSO retired. Applicant was not fully familiar with his
duties and responsibilities, and relied on the security team supporting him, “on the job
training,”  and  the  supervision  of  the  information  systems  security  manager  (ISSM).
Historical audit computer logs were backed up on rewritable compact discs (CD) that were
marked  with  the  appropriate  security  classification,  since  the  information  was  being
written from a classified system. The CDs were kept in plastic sleeves in a portfolio binder,
marked  with  classification  markings,  and  secured.  Applicant’s  assistant  ISSO  (AISSO)
was required to create the CDs for a historical record, until the company transferred all of
the logs to external hard drives. The CDs were phased out, and another new AISSO was
tasked to ensure the destruction of the old CDs. Applicant and his assistant emptied all
of the CDs from their plastic sleeves in the binder, and sent the “empty” portfolio binder
to a supply room to be reused. The supply room was in an access-controlled area, but
not a classified controlled area. The binder was later discovered by an employee with one
CD still in a sleeve. Applicant claims the CD did not have any classified information on it,
but it was marked “classified” because the data came from a classified computer system.
Applicant was cited for a security violation, but there was no evidence of loss, compromise
or suspected compromise of classified information found. Applicant took responsibility for
the mistake, was given remedial training, and never repeated this security violation again.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant improperly used his system administrator logins and
passwords,  and failed  to follow  user privileges  and  information  assurance  procedures.
Shortly after assuming the ISSO position, Applicant was tasked to work on an information
system (IS) with which he was previously unfamiliar. He was read into the program, and
entered the particular lab in 2015, where he first saw a completely assembled IS system.
He noted that the IS had not been certified, however it was already located in a special
secured area. Applicant was tasked to certify it by the security official for the program. At
the  time,  common  practice  was  to  allow  the  ISSO  to  log  into  the  system  using  root
credentials, but that practice was later stopped. Applicant met with the security staff for
the  program  and  explained  what  he  needed  to  do  to  certify  the  IS,  and  Applicant
requested  that  the  security  department  permit  another  system  administrator  (SA)  who
developed the IS, to assist him. The SA was briefed by the program security officer and
permitted  to  enter  the  space.  Applicant  later  learned  that  the  security  official  was  not
authorized to give the SA both a general user and a privileged user briefing at once. One
of the briefings should have been done by another security office within the company, but
Applicant noted it was often done by the same person. According to Applicant, once the
oversight was discovered, the SA received the proper authorization “within five minutes,”
and believed his actions were authorized and the most efficient method to accomplish the
task.
Applicant  was  also  alleged  to have  continued  to  use the  root account for logins
after the system had been certified, and that he failed to document the logins using the
root account for tracking and auditing purposes. Applicant explained that using the root
credentials  was  the  only  way  to  solve  the  problems  with  the  IS,  and  that  the  security
department should have made logs available to be used to document occasions where
the root certification was used. However, Applicant took responsibility for not logging the
uses properly, and testified that logins were in fact traceable, even without the logs. As a
result  of  the  security  violation,  Applicant  was  denied  access  to  particular  programs
operated  by  that  military  branch.  No  evidence  of  loss,  compromise,  or  suspected
compromise of classified information was found.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant was relieved of his ISSO duties and access to
secure areas in October 2017, after self-inspections disclosed repeated failures to comply
with the information system configuration and operational security requirements, policies,
and procedures. In particular, the Government’s evidence shows various non-compliance
issues with users on the system, user briefings, seal logs, incomplete permissions and
auditing settings, poor maintenance log retention, laptop CD/DVD drive and removable
media  controls  not  configured  properly,  and  no  system  warning  banner  displayed.  In
addition, Applicant did not correct the deficiencies within the two-week period provided.
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  responsible  for  keeping  track  of  200  user
authorizations  for  18  systems.  There  were  discussions  and  changes  to  the  user
authorization procedures and forms during this period, and that the system in question
was housed at a military base under a mobile deployment plan to allow it to be operated
in the field. At the same time the system was returned to Applicant’s facility for audits,
patching,  and  updates  after  a  longer-than-usual  period  outside  the  facility,  a  self-
inspection was conducted. Applicant supported the self-inspection and was interested in
seeing the results so that he could make the corrections and return the system back to
the field. Applicant argued that the ISSM agreed with the field engineers to permit them
to  create  user  accounts  and  were  responsible  for  the  system  while  it  was  outside
Applicant’s facility. Applicant did not have physical access to the system or oversight while
it was in the field, and the engineers improperly created new user accounts for personnel
that needed access while the system was deployed.
Applicant  sent  his  ASSOs  to  the  meeting  to  discuss  the  self-inspection  findings
because  of  a  conflict,  and  later  learned  that  his  ASSOs  did  not  make  the  simple
corrections to fix the deficiencies. Applicant’s access was denied before he could inspect
the  system  on  his  own,  and  was  not  fully  apprised  of  the  deficiencies  after  the  self-
inspection. After being denied access, Applicant spent the next two weeks instructing his
ASSOs on how to correct the deficiencies. Applicant admits he should have been more
forceful  in  demanding  the  list  of  findings  of  the  self-inspection  and  more  proactive  in
addressing the problems, but relied on others to do the work. Applicant agrees that he
was responsible for supervising his ASSOs in completing the work required, but notes
that security rules changed after the system was certified for deployment. He disagreed
with  some  of  the  findings  regarding  hard  drives,  and  asserted  that  the  ISSM  shared
responsibility for the system, certified it for mobile deployment, and should have worked
with him to correct deficiencies once they were discovered, rather than deny him access.
He  also  acknowledged  that  he  was  aware  of  one  previous  user  agreement  deficiency
before  the  2017  findings,  but  not  the  other  previous  deficiencies  noted  in  the  self-
inspection  report.  No  compromise  of  classified  information  or  counter-intelligence
implications were found as a result of the incidents discussed above.
Applicant emphatically denies any intention to violate security rules or procedures
during any of the incidents listed in the SOR. He had never had a security violation in the
past, despite nearly 30 years with a top secret security clearance. He believes the large
volume  of  work  and  poor  training  and  directions  from  his  manager  led  to  the  eventual
security violations. Applicant submitted a detailed narrative response to the allegations,
a 2016 security training certification, a certificate of recognition from his company,  and
other  documents  in  support  of  his  testimony.  His  testimony  was  comprehensive,
straightforward, and sincere, while always maintaining his professionalism.
Applicant’s former information systems security risk manager and former ISSM at
the company provided a signed, sworn statement of support for Applicant, and claimed
that three unnamed employees within the information security office targeted Applicant
and other employees to interpret the rules to find security infractions in order to cause
them to lose their security clearance and job. He noted that once an infraction was found,
the  employee  had  very  little  recourse  in  defense.  He  also  noted  that  Applicant  was
trustworthy,  and  called  him  an  asset  to  the  community  that  cares  about  protecting
classified information and a proud supporter of the warfighter. No corroborating evidence
of  inappropriate  behavior  of  security  personnel  at  the  company  was  presented  at  the
hearing, but Applicant quoted the writer’s claim in his Answer to the SOR.
Another coworker attested to Applicant’s good judgment, stating he would never
knowingly  violate  security  regulations  or  procedures,  and  noted  Applicant  was
conscientious, stable, caring, and trustworthy. A director of security for another defense
contractor who has known Applicant since 1987 when they were friends and coworkers,
wrote of Applicant’s “great integrity.” A current engineer at Applicant’s company wrote of
Applicant’s  reliability,  good  judgment,  stability,  and  responsibility.  He  notes  situations
where  Applicant  steadfastly  followed  security  rules  to  maintain  security  compliance
regardless of user complaints or inconvenience.
",True
"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  under  this  guideline.    After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.    He  is  married,  and  has  one  minor  son.    He  has  a
Master’s  degree  in  Systems  Engineering.    He  holds  the  position  of  System  Test
Engineer for a defense contractor.
Applicant  was  born  in  Vietnam  in  1981.    He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in
1995 with his father and younger brother.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen
in 2003.  (Tr. p. 22.)  He graduated from college with his bachelor’s degree in 2006, and
received  his  Master’s  degree  in  2012.    He  has  been  employed  with  his  current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  2008  and  has  held  a  security  clearance  since
then.    Applicant  testified  that  since  obtaining  his  security  clearance,  he  has  received
annual security briefings from his employer as a refresher.  (Tr. p. 23.)
While  working  for  his  current  employer,  since  2008,  Applicant  has  committed
three security violations and/or infractions occurring in 2014, 2016, and 2017.  The first
one occurred in September 2014.  On this occasion, Applicant left classified information
unattended in violation of his company’s security regulations.  Applicant explained that
he  had  been  working  late,  writing  what  he  calls  a  test  procedure,  in  a  classified  room
within a safe lab, known as a secret area, when he wrote several numbers down on a
piece  of  paper.    (Tr.  p.  24-25.)    He  left  the  piece  of  paper  on  the  table.    Another
individual came in the following morning and found the piece of paper with the numbers
on  it  and  reported  it  to  company  security  department.    While  conducting  their
investigation,  they  determined that no  one  had accessed  the area since Applicant  left.
(Tr. p. 26.)  Following this security infraction, Applicant was interviewed by the security
department and he was required to provide a written statement about the incident and
received  a  security  infraction  that  was  placed  in  his  company  personnel  file.    He  was
also  required  to  take  and  complete  the  annual  security  training  immediately  after  the
incident.  (Tr. p 27.)
The second security violation occurred in November 2016.  Applicant stated that
he  was  the  response  engineer  for  a  test  procedure  in  an  unclassified  program
document.  He had been working on the document for some time and had made several
revisions, updates to the procedures, and put numbers to the procedure.  At some point,
it was discovered by the customer that Applicant had  included classified information in
the document.  (Tr. p. 29.)  The customer sent it to their security department, and it was
determined  to  be  a  Code  Blue,  where  there  was  a  mass  data  containment  effort.
Industrial  security  investigators  later  confirmed  that  the  classified  information  in  the
program  document  was  compromised.    Following  this security  violation,  Applicant  was
interviewed by the security department and was required to provide a written statement
about the incident, and he received a security violation that was placed his company’s
personnel file.   Once again, he was required to take and complete the annual security
training.
Applicant’s  third  security  violation  occurred  in  or  about  April  2017.    This  time,
Applicant did not properly check to ensure that the classified safe was properly closed.
Applicant explained that he signed an acknowledgment form attesting to the fact that he
witnessed  his  supervisor  properly  secure  a  safe  holding  classified  documents.    The
company  security  department  conducted  a  daily  scan  and  discovered  that  they  were
able to open the safe, and that it had not been properly secured in violation of company
security regulations.  Applicant later realized that he had not pulled down the handle to
ensure  that  it  could  was  properly  secured.    Following  this  security  violation,  Applicant
was  interviewed  by  the  security  department  and  was  required  to  provide  a  written
statement  about  the  incident.    He  received  a  security  violation  that  was  placed  his
company’s  personnel  file.      Once  again,  he  was  required  to  take  and  complete  the
annual security training.
Applicant  states  that  he  was  never  disciplined  for  any  of  the  three  security
infractions/violations.  He  believes  that the first two  incidents  occurred  because  he  did
not understand the information enough to know that it was considered classified.  The
third  violation  he  admits  occurred  because  he  simply  missed  it  and  made  a  mistake.
(Tr. p. 40.)
Performance  evaluations  of  the  Applicant  for  2015,  2016,  and  2017,  are
favorable and reflect that he is a “Top Performer.”  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
Five  letters  of  recommendation  from  fellow  colleagues  and  upper  management
who  know  and  work  with  the  Applicant,  namely  a  Senior  Computer  Engineer  and
coworker,  a  Program  Director,  an  Engineering
fellow,  and  Applicant’s  current
supervisor,  each  reflect  that  they  believe  Applicant  is  a  dedicated  individual  who
demonstrates a high level of technical capability, integrity, honesty and trustworthiness.
Applicant is recommended for a security clearance.   (Applicant’s Exhibits B, C, D, and
E.)

"Applicant is a 58-year-old single woman. Since 2012, she has worked as a security
assistant  for  various  federal  contractors.  (GE  1  at  9-24)  According  to  her  current
supervisor, with whom she has worked since July 2016, she is a conscientious worker who
comes  to  work  on  time  and  on  a  regular  basis.  Moreover,  her  integrity  is  “beyond
reproach,” and she has the strongest work ethic of any of his subordinates. (Tr. 52-53) A
former  coworker  characterized  Applicant  as  “a  very  professional,  funny,  caring,  and
conscious professional,” who was well-liked by the team, and who always ensured that
each  member  of  the  team  participated  in  each  team-building  activity.  (Answer  at  6)
Another coworker, who worked with Applicant from approximately July 2016 to July 2018,
characterized her as “dependable, real self-motivated, and loyal.” (Tr. 60)
Applicant was granted a security clearance in 2012. (GE 1 at 41) It was suspended
in 2016, pending the outcome of this security clearance decision. (GE 3 at 2)
SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges that in December 2015, during an interview with a
panel of employees from a contracting firm, Applicant disclosed that she kept access code
combinations written down on a piece of paper in her possession while working for her
then-employer, between October and November 2015,  and that she verbally disclosed
access code combinations. Applicant acknowledges that she underwent an interview in
December 2015, and that she discussed the security procedure for opening the Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) where she was then working. (Tr. 24) However,
she denies that she either failed to follow security procedures when she worked in the
SCIF, or that she disclosed access combinations during the interview. Specifically, she
testified that the SCIF where she worked could be entered with security cards. Before the
security  cards  could  operate,  the  agency’s  security specialist,1 as the first  person who
arrived each morning, had to open it by unlocking each of the three successive doors that
led to the SCIF. (Tr. 37) After this task was performed, the SCIF was accessible by security
cards for the remainder of the day. (Tr. 39-40)
1 Applicant was working onsite at a federal government agency. (Answer at 7)
One day, the security specialist asked Applicant to open the SCIF the following
morning. He issued Applicant the code to a secured cabinet, which Applicant used to open
the  cabinet  lock  and  retrieve  an  envelope  with  three  combinations  enclosed  for  the
successive doors. (Tr. 25) To aid her memory, Applicant wrote the combinations to the
successive doors on a sheet of paper. (GE 4 at 3) After opening each successive door and
getting to her desk, which was located in the SCIF, she tore up the paper and placed it in
her  burn  bag.  (Tr.  46)  The  paper  that  contained  the  combinations  was  never  out  of
Applicant’s possession when she was referring to it to open the combinations. (Tr. 25)
Applicant  never  performed  morning  SCIF-opening  duty  again.  (Tr.  25)  There  is
conflicting  record  information  concerning  whether  writing  down  security  access  codes
constituted a security infraction.  She contends that writing down the codes for the security
doors, then tearing them up and disposing them in a burn bag was not a security infraction.
(Tr. 32) A character witness testified that it constituted a security infraction to write down a
combination to a classified cabinet. (Tr. 67)  There is no record evidence of a company rule
or procedure that addresses this issue.
SOR  subparagraph  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  told  the  interview  panel  at  the
December  2015  interview,  that  she  hears  voices  in  her  head.  Applicant  denies  this
allegation. (Answer; Tr. 29) She has never heard imaginary voices or been diagnosed with
a  psychiatric  condition,  nor  has  she  ever  sought  treatment  or  been  hospitalized  for  a
psychiatric  condition.  (Tr.  29)  After  Applicant  learned  of  the  allegation  set  forth  in
subparagraph 1.b, she contacted the head of the panel that interviewed her in 2015. The
panel chairwoman denied making this allegation. (GE 4 at 3)
Applicant has been receiving medical services from a primary care provider since
2012. (Tr. 30) According to a nurse practitioner from the practice, Applicant is not being
treated for any psychiatric conditions. (AE D) Per a friend who has known Applicant for 20
years, she has never displayed any symptoms of a psychiatric condition. (Tr. 57) Similarly,
a  coworker  who  worked  with  Applicant  in  2012  noticed  no  symptoms  indicative  of  a
psychiatric condition. (Tr. 64)
The  allegations  that  form  the  basis  of  the  SOR  were  reported  to  the  Defense
Security  Service  (DSS)  by  the  facility  security  officer  of  the  company  where  Applicant
interviewed, on December 21, 2015, three days after the interview occurred. (GE 3) On
March 15, 2016, DSS suspended Applicant’s security clearance. (GE 3 at 2)
The DSS report does not identify the individuals who made the adverse statements.
It also incorrectly states Applicant’s place of employment at the time of the interview. (Tr.

",True
"Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  personnel  security  representative  for  a  defense
contractor, employed since 2008. She was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 2006 and a
master’s degree in 2012. She is married and has no children. She has held a security
clearance since 2008.
The SOR alleges Applicant had four security infractions from 2008 to 2017. She
admitted the allegations, with explanations. In 2008, while new to the company, Applicant
inadvertently carried a camera in her handbag into a closed area where she worked. She
sat at her desk, and was looking through her handbag when she discovered the camera.
At  the  time,  cameras,  but  not  cell  phones,  were  prohibited  in  the  space.  The  camera
remained  off,  and  Applicant  immediately  showed  the  camera  to  her  security  manager.
The company reported that no classified information was put at risk in the incident.
In 2015, Applicant inadvertently scanned two program access requests (PAR) into
a computer system. The PAR is unclassified but contains sensitive personal information.
Applicant and another employee, both new to the position, were tasked to scan thousands
of PARs as a group, into a computer system. The employees were not required to review
each document for sensitive information, but a random check was done. After the PARs
were  entered  into  the  computer  system,  Applicant  noticed  two  PARs  with  sensitive
information that should not have been scanned, and reported it to her security manager.
Applicant’s supervisor, the company’s security manager, testified that the incident was
not Applicant’s fault, rather, she completed the task as directed and could not have known
the two particular PARs in the stack of PARs held sensitive information. The incident was
reported and investigated as an infraction so that it could be properly documented, but no
loss or compromise of sensitive information was found.
In 2016, Applicant was again tasked to scan documents into a computer system,
but to redact with a black marker, sensitive, unclassified data on some documents before
scanning them. According to Applicant’s security manager, Applicant followed directions
exactly  as  tasked,  but  noticed  that  some  redacted  documents  still  showed  information
through the redaction after scanning. Again, the security manager testified that Applicant
was not at fault for the incident, but that she followed directions exactly as tasked, and
Applicant reported the incident as soon as it was discovered. The company’s method of
redaction was changed. Again, the incident was reported and investigated as an infraction
so  that  it  could  be  properly  documented,  but  no  loss  or  compromise  of  sensitive
information was found.
In  2017,  Applicant  allowed  an  unauthorized  individual  into  a  classified  space.
Applicant was tasked to provide a classified security briefing to new employees. She was
provided  a  classified  cover  sheet  from  the  government  client,  listing  employees  to  be
briefed. The cover sheet identified all listed employees as cleared, but the underlying PAR
for one of the employees was “disapproved” and should not have appeared on the cover
sheet. Applicant reviewed the cover sheet, but did not realize that one employee listed
was disapproved on his PAR. Applicant conducted the brief, but afterward she found that
the  cover sheet misidentified  the  employee as  approved for the brief  and  reported the
incident  to  her  supervisor.  The  employee  was  eventually  approved  for  the  brief.  The
incident was referred to the on-site Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) agent,
who testified on behalf of Applicant. The OSI agent indicated that the government client
misidentified the employee, and that the improper briefing was not the fault of Applicant.
He  has  worked  with  Applicant  on  a  regular  basis  and  believes  she  is  honest  and
trustworthy. He unequivocally recommends Applicant retain her security clearance.
Applicant acknowledged the security incidents and took responsibility for all of the
incidents, despite the fact that three of the four incidents were outside of her responsibility.
The  company  compliance  lead,  Applicant’s  current  security  manager,  and  on-site  OSI
agent testified on behalf of Applicant and attested that she was not directly responsible
for  the  last  three  incidents  and  the  camera  incident  was  minor.  They  all  believe  that
Applicant’s honesty and trustworthiness make her a unique fit for the security office and
that  she  complies  with  security  rules  and  regulations.  Applicant  promptly  reported  all
infractions once discovered and learned how to prevent further incidents in the future.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline K: Handling Protected Information
",True
"Applicant  is a 52-year-old married man with two teenage children. He earned a
Bachelor of Science degree in architecture in 1994, and an associate’s degree in project
management in 2007. (AE A at 2) He has been working in the information technology field
since 1984, and has been a program manager since 2003. He was first granted a security
clearance in 2006. (AE A at 2)
Applicant is an engineer who installs and upgrades fiber security systems. (AE C at
1) His current supervisor, who has worked with him in various capacities for 34 years,
characterizes him as an exceptional engineer who performs his duties above and beyond
the scope of work required by their clients. (AE C at 1)
Applicant worked for his previous employer from 2010 to 2013.  (GE 1 at 11) He
supervised a team of five engineers and ten technicians as part of a project to upgrade the
network systems. (Tr. 75; GE 2) The project was two pronged. It first involved going to
several  rooms  to  inventory  the  network  systems  and  determine  which  needed  to  be
physically  replaced,  then  replacing  the  systems  that  needed  to  be  upgraded.  (Tr.  89)
Applicant’s team worked on the identification and inventory prong of the project. (Tr. 89,
106) Each day, team members went to multiple classified rooms and security closets. Entry
to  these  rooms  was  controlled  by  up  to  two  combination  locks,  depending  upon  the
classification level. (Tr. 90)
Each day, Applicant went to a swipe-access-controlled sensitive compartmented
information facility (SCIF) to retrieve the combinations. The combinations that controlled
access to SCIFs were in a separate room than the lock combinations for the rooms that
housed lower-level classified information. (Tr. 105) Each of the combinations had three
numbers.
Because the numbers to the combinations were classified, Applicant could not write
them  down.  Instead,  he  had  to  memorize  them.  After  retrieving  the  combinations  and
memorizing them, he would pass them along to his team members, who would then go to
the respective rooms to execute their assignments. (Tr. 134-135) Combinations could not
be disclosed in unclassified facilities.
Memorizing  all  of  these  numbers  in  the  proper  order  was  challenging.  At  most,
Applicant had to memorize “30 different numbers in a specific order, couple[d] with nine to
eighteen different combinations.” (Tr. 106 -107) If he forgot a combination, he had to return
to the room where he had originally received it. This could slow the project by 30 minutes.
(Tr. 115) In late 2012, an engineer who worked at Applicant’s company suggested that he
store  the  combination  codes  in  his  personal  cell  phone.  (Tr.  117,  127)  He  provided
Applicant with encryption software to protect the information which Applicant downloaded
onto his phone. Applicant did not check with his FSO or supervisor  about whether the
encryption software had been approved for use by either his employer or the agency. (Tr.
142)
Using the encryption software, Applicant began inputting the classified combinations
into  his  personal  cell  phone.  (Tr.  127)  He  would  later  refer  to  the  cell  phone  for  the
combinations to help remember them when he provided them to his subordinates. The
disclosure of these classified combinations to his subordinates occurred in an unclassified,
open office space. (GE 2 at 2) Applicant thought the room was classified because it was
secured  by  a  special  lock.  (Tr.  129)  It  is  unclear  from  the  record  how  long  Applicant
obtained and shared classified combinations in this fashion.
In November 2012, the DOD’s inspector general’s office received an anonymous
complaint about Applicant’s security practices regarding the classified combinations. (GE 2
at  1;  AE  F)  The  anonymous  complaint  also  alleged  that  Applicant  wrote  classified
combinations in a black book. Applicant denied this allegation about the black book and the
investigation includes no finding regarding this allegation. (Tr. 123, 139)
The  complaint  was  referred  to  the  facility  and  personnel security  division of the
department where Applicant was performing his contract work. The complaint prompted an
investigation that began in April 2013. (GE 6, Enclosure (Enc.) 6; AE F) Subsequently, the
then-chief security manager interviewed Applicant. During the interview, he “clearly and
freely admitted that he did house those combinations, and he did disclose them to his
personnel . . . .” (Tr. 24)
According to the former chief security manager, Applicant and the other contractors
received  security  briefings  every  month.  (Tr. 25) Applicant contended that the security
training he received was generic and did not address the subject of storing combinations
on personal phones. (Tr. 114) Moreover, he contended storing information on his phone
enabled him to get more combinations to his teammates more quickly, without having to
return  multiple  times  to  the  rooms  where  he  was  required  to  go  to  retrieve  them.  By
promoting efficiency, Applicant “thought it was for the betterment of the team.” (Tr. 115)
After  completing  the  investigation  in  May  of  2013,  the  chief  security  manager
concluded  that  Applicant’s  actions  caused  a  compromise  of  classified  combinations.
Additionally,  he  concluded  that  “contract  security  officers  [were]  not  properly  briefing
contractor personnel on their security responsibilities.” (GE 2 at 2; AE F) Ultimately he
recommended that Applicant’s access to classified information be terminated.
Because  of  Applicant’s  security  violation,  the  agency  had  to  change  all  of  the
combinations. Changing the 400 to 500 combinations required 192 work-hours.  (Tr. 27)
The chief security manager who conducted the investigation testified at the hearing.
He stated that his investigation into Applicant’s improper handling of classified information
also included reviewing the guidance involving memorizing multiple combinations. (Tr. 52)
As part of the review process, the chief security manager and his team consulted with
various work groups that needed access to classified spaces in an effort to ascertain “how
[they] could actually assist these people and still keep from having compromises.” (Tr. 55)
He  concluded  that  the  procedure  which  involved  contractors  memorizing  as  many
combinations as possible was not  a good practice. (Tr. 53) Consequently, the security
manager and  his staff  developed  a  new policy where “you would have to come to the
security office, make your case for a number of combinations and we would be the ones to
vet and provide those combinations to you in our classified facilities.” (Tr. 55)
On May 22, 2013, Applicant’s employer placed him on unpaid administrative leave,
pending its investigation. (GE 6, Enc. 3) This decision was reached because Applicant,
absent a security clearance, was “not permitted to complete [his] duties as outlined in [his]
employment  agreement  .  .  .”  (GE  6,  Enc.  3)  As  part  of  the  company’s  out-processing
procedures, he was required to turn in all of his building access keys and badges, and to
attend a security debriefing. (GE 6, Enc. 4) In addition, he was instructed that his health
benefits were set to terminate within ten days of the unpaid administrative leave notice.
(GE 6, Enc. 3) The memo setting forth these instructions does not characterize Applicant’s
pending departure as a termination.
On March 1, 2016, the FSO of Applicant’s former employer responded to a request
for background information received from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as
part of a new clearance investigation. (GE 6; AE F) In his response, the FSO noted that
Applicant’s continued assertion that he did not receive the proper training to handle the
classified information “confirms that he was not, and is not capable of handling classified
information  because  common  sense  dictates  the  information  he  was  handling  was
classified and his handling of it . . .  was improper.” (AE 6 at 1)
According to an individual whom Applicant supervised on a job prior to the job where
the  security  violation  occurred,  he  was  a  “serious-minded  professional”  who  made
information security “his highest priority.” (AE C at 4) He corrected this former subordinate
on one occasion, and taught him how “to keep multiple sources of information, floor plans
and  cut-sheets,  securely  stored  separately,  and  not  together.”  (AE  C  at  4)  His  former
supervisor at the job where the security violation occurred characterizes it as an anomaly
that does not reflect Applicant’s ability to protect classified information. (AE C at 5) He
frequently observed Applicant mentoring subordinates on physical security issues. (AE C at
5)
According  to  one  of  Applicant’s  former  coworkers  who  was  involved  with  his
termination, Applicant was removed from his position, pending an investigation into the
alleged  security  violation  and  because  there  were  no  other  positions  available  in  the
company that were commensurate with his experience, credentials, or compensation. (AE
D at 1)  He considers Applicant to be “honest, very detailed, and passionate about his
work.” (AE D at 1)
Applicant completed a security clearance application in February 2016. In response
to the question whether he had ever been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, left
by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of  misconduct  or  unsatisfactory
performance, he answered “yes,” explaining that he left the position by mutual agreement,
as  discussed  above,  for  “alleged  violation  of  security  procedures  that  [he]  had  never
received proper training.” (GE 1 at 12)
Another question on the February 2016 security application asked whether Applicant
had ever received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined
for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy. He answered, “yes,”
again referencing the position that he left in 2013, explaining that he was punished for an
“alleged violation of security procedures that [he] was never trained on.” (GE 1 at 13)
A government investigator interviewed Applicant in March 2017. He told the agent
that he left his previous employer by mutual agreement following the security violation
allegations, and that he was eligible for re-hire. (Tr.  152-153) He believed this to be the
case because he never was told that he could not return.
Applicant has continued to take security trainings over the years. In March 2019, he
completed a counterintelligence training, and later that month, he completed an annual
security awareness refresher course. (AE D3 at 1; AE D4 at 1)
",False
"Applicant’s SOR response admitted the facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a.
(Tr.  21-22;  HE  3)  He  also  provided  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 39-year-old Air Force mission planner employed by a government
contractor. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) In 1998, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2018,
he received a bachelor of science degree in liberal arts. (Tr. 6) He served in the Air Force
from 1998 to 2008. (Tr. 7, 22) He left active duty as a staff sergeant (E-5), and he received
an honorable discharge. (Tr. 7) His Air Force specialty was cable-antenna technician, and
he cross-trained as an airborne cryptologic linguist. He held a top secret clearance with
access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) starting in 2006. (Tr. 7, 23) He has
worked for his current employer since September 2017. (Tr. 8) In 1997, Applicant married,
and his children are ages 16, 18, and 20. (Tr. 8)
Removal of Classified Document from a SCI Facility (SCIF)
Applicant received routine training about handling of classified information. (Tr. 24-
25,  27)  In  2008,  Applicant  attended  training  inside  a  SCIF,  which  involved  his  use  of
classified  documents.  (Tr.  28)  He  unintentionally  brought  a  document  classified  at  the
secret  level  to  his  home,  and  he  stored  it  in  a  file  box  in  his  garage.  (Tr.  28-29;  SOR
response) The document was clearly marked as secret. (Tr. 29)2 In about March 2011,
he  discovered  the  classified  document  in  his  garage.  (Tr.  28;  63)  He  transported  the
classified  document  to  an  Air  Force  unit  where  he  was  working,  and  he  shredded  the
document.  (Tr.  30)  He  did  not  have  authorization  to  transport  classified  documents
outside  of  the  SCIF.  (Tr.  61)  He  did  not  timely  disclose  his  possession  at  home  and
subsequent  destruction  of  the  classified  document  because  he  did  not  want  to  get  in

in the cited exhibits.
2  In  Applicant’s  April  19,  2016  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  or  security
clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant  said  the  document  he  erroneously  took  home  was  “protected
information” not classified information. (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) At his hearing, he acknowledged that
it was a classified document, and he conceded it was possible that he was trying to minimize what he had
done in his SCA by not characterizing the document as classified. (Tr. 58-59) No adverse inference is made
because of Applicant’s incorrect description of his handling of the classified document in his SCA.
trouble. (Tr. 30-31) Several months after he destroyed the classified document, Applicant
was  interviewed  before  his  counterintelligence  polygraph  examination.  (Tr.  31,  63)  He
disclosed  to  the  polygrapher that  he mishandled  the  classified  document  in  2008, and
destroyed  it  in  2011.  (Tr.  31-32,  63-65)  He  passed  the  counterintelligence  polygraph
examination  in  2011.  (Tr.  65)  His  security  clearance  was  suspended  for  about  three
months after his 2011 polygraph due to his mishandling of the classified document. (Tr.
32, 57-58)
Polygraph Countermeasures
Prior to 2016, Applicant had done some research on methods of manipulating the
polygraph-test result. (Tr. 45-46, 55-56) In 2016, Applicant was scheduled for a routine
counterintelligence-polygraph examination. (Tr. 35) The polygrapher discussed the test
questions and polygraph procedures with Applicant during the pre-polygraph interview.
(Tr. 36-37) Applicant was aware that his rate of breathing could affect the polygraph-test
results. (Tr. 66) Before a polygraph examination, the polygrapher tells the person being
tested  to  give  false  answers  to  control  questions  about  mundane  topics  such  as  the
number of times the test taker drove in excess of the speed limit or the number of times
the  test  taker  caused  a  family  member  to  be  angered.  These  control  questions  are
considered “known lies.” The physiological responses, including rate of breathing, to the
control  questions  are  compared  to  the  responses  to  the  questions  relevant  to
counterintelligence  issues.  (Tr.  38-39,  49-50)  To  pass  the  polygraph,  there  should  be
more of a physiological response to lying to a control question than telling the truth on a
relevant question.
During  the  polygraph  examination,  the  polygrapher  accused  Applicant  of
attempting to manipulate the polygraph-test results. (Tr. 37) Applicant admitted that he
was “breathing faster and kind of tricked [himself] into being scared” during the control
questions.  (Tr.  38)  He  attempted  to  magnify  or  exaggerate  his  responses  during  the
control questions. (Tr. 38, 45, 48-49) He said he believed his physiological responses to
the control questions were too low, and he became scared. (Tr. 39-40) He was just trying
to ensure he had the “desired response” to enable him to pass the polygraph. (Tr. 39-40)
He  admitted  to  the  polygrapher  that  he  was  trying  to  manipulate  the  polygraph  test
through fast breathing. (Tr. 45) He subsequently told an Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) investigator that he wanted his answers to the control questions to “light up like a
Christmas tree.” (Tr. 43) He admitted that he intentionally  attempted to manipulate the
polygraph-test results. (Tr. 44)
Applicant  claimed  that  during  the  polygraph  he  did  not  understand  that  his
manipulative efforts could cause an erroneous polygraph-test result. (Tr. 50) He believed
he was helping the polygrapher receive an accurate test result through his enhancement
of his responses to the control questions. (Tr. 54) In other words, he did not believe there
was  any  reason  to  suspect  himself  of  being  a  counterintelligence  concern,  and  his
manipulation  was  designed  to  ensure  the  polygrapher  did  not  erroneously  find  a
counterintelligence issue. He understands now that his efforts to “assist” the polygrapher
by breathing faster during the control questions did not actually help the polygrapher. (Tr.
54-55) Applicant has not taken a counterintelligence polygraph after the 2016 test was
terminated due to his countermeasures. (Tr. 62)
Applicant  said  he  accepted  responsibility  for  his  decisions,  and  if  he  had  an
opportunity to make the same decisions that he made in 2011 and 2016 now, he would
choose differently and scrupulously comply with security requirements. (Tr. 67) He had
no fear of providing answers to the counterintelligence questions, and he would timely
report security violations. (Tr. 67)
Character Evidence
An Air Force captain and a program manager described Applicant as careful about
compliance with security requirements. (AE A; AE B) Applicant has sound judgment and
is  loyal  to  the  United  States.  Applicant  has  an  excellent  reputation  and  contributes  to
mission accomplishment. They support continuation of Applicant’s security clearance.
",True
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 61-year-old married father with two adult children. He has worked
for his defense-contractor employer since August 1983. In 2010, he assumed the duties
of  alternate  COMSEC  custodian  for  the  engineering  department  at  his  facility,  and  he
transitioned into the role of lead COMSEC custodian by 2014. Applicant  held a Secret
clearance from November 1993 until June 2010, when it was upgraded to  Top Secret.
That clearance was renewed most recently in April 2015. (GEs 1, 3; AEs E-F, H; Tr. 52-
54.) He works in a building where all employees are required to possess a minimum of
a DOD Secret clearance (Tr. 39, 55, 67), and he has had security training on an annual
basis over the years. (Tr. 55-56.)
that  housed  COMSEC  equipment
Applicant had an unblemished record for any security infractions before he  took
on  COMSEC  custodian  duties  at  the  request  of  his  then  supervisor.  (Tr.  69,  73.)  The
supervisor  considered  Applicant  the  best  candidate  because  of  his  reputation,  his
administrative  skills,  and  his  integrity.  (Tr.  74.)  While  leaving  work  one  day  in  late
August  2013,  Applicant  failed  to  spin  an  X-09  lock  on  the  door  to  a  stand-alone
COMSEC  closed  area
for  multiple  satellite
communications  programs.  Then  the  alternate  COMSEC  custodian  at  his  facility,  he
was  distracted  by  other  duties  as  he  conducted  end-of-the-day  security  checks.
Approximately  15  minutes  after  he  left  work,  an  information  security  systems  (ISS)
employee discovered that the door to the room was shut, but was not properly secured
in  that  the  lock  had  not  been  spun.  A  co-worker  with  appropriate  access  to  the
COMSEC  area  secured  the  room,  and  the  ISS  employee  contacted  Applicant,  who
returned to work and visually inspected the area. He determined that there had been no
attempt  at  unauthorized  access.  Applicant  and  his  supervisor  reported  the  incident  to
his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  the  next  day.  The  facility’s  FSO  conducted  an
administrative inquiry into the incident and determined that no compromise of classified
information had occurred. Under the company’s security procedures, a written report of
the violation was issued for the “administrative” violation. Applicant was reminded of the
proper  procedures  for  securing  closed  areas  and  of  the  company’s  security  policy
providing  for  disciplinary  action  of  up  to  a  five-day  suspension  for  any  additional
violation within a 12-month period. (GEs 2-3, 6; Tr. 47, 56-57, 68.)
The  number  of  programs  requiring  COMSEC  support  increased  significantly
starting in 2014. (Tr. 66.) As lead COMSEC custodian, Applicant had the difficult task of
working through a new electronic keying system. He managed 12 classified COMSEC
safes  secured  by  X-09  locks  and  handled  all  the  crypto-security  for  two  separate
facilities for his employer while mentoring a new alternate COMSEC custodian. (Tr. 43-
45.)  He  worked  long  hours,  including  some  weekends,  to  ensure  that  programs  met
their  schedules.  He  presided  over  government  audits  with  “No  Findings.”  (AEs  E-F.)
Applicant’s  annual  performance  evaluation  for  2015  shows  that  he  had  earned  the
respect of his supervisor and peers. Applicant’s supervisor indicated that Applicant had
done  “a  great  job  handling  the  ever  changing  requirements  for  COMSEC.”  He  gave
Applicant an overall rating of “exceeds requirements.” (AE E.)
Applicant continued to do an “outstanding job” as COMSEC custodian in 2016. In
evaluating  Applicant’s  performance  for  2016,  Applicant’s  supervisor  remarked  that
Applicant  took  his  job  very  seriously,  worked  well  with  others,  and  had  become  their
expert  “on  the  generation,  architect,  and  maintaining  of  all  COMSEC  hardware  and
keys.” Time and time again, Applicant worked tirelessly to meet the demands of all the
engineers and their programs. (AE D.)
In  March  2017,  Applicant  left  a  GSA-approved  container  in  the  COMSEC  room
unattended and unsecured for about 15 minutes. The safe was approved for storage of
Secret  information  and  contained  classified  COMSEC  equipment  and  combinations.  It
was  one  of  seven  containers  approved  for  storage  of  classified  COMSEC  material
located  within  the  COMSEC  closed  area.  Access  to  the  COMSEC  closed  area  was
restricted  to  three  individuals  with  the  combination  and  swipe  access.  The  COMSEC
area  was  inside  another  approved  DOD  Secret  closed  area  where  Applicant  was
assisting  some  engineers.  The  violation  was  discovered  by  a  company  industrial
security employee while conducting a security self-inspection. When questioned by his
FSO about his procedures that morning, Applicant acknowledged that he had departed
the  COMSEC  room  to  assist  some  engineers  within  the  larger  closed  area  without
securing the safe “because he believed that since the container was located inside an
approved closed area no action needed to occur.” (GE 4.) Applicant now does not recall
telling  the  FSO  that  he  did  not  need  to  secure  the  safe  because  he  knew  the  proper
procedure to secure the classified container was by spinning the X-09 locks. (Tr. 58-59.)
He  attributes  his  security  infraction  to  “a  lot  going  on  that  day.”  (Tr.  68.)  The  FSO
conducted  an  internal  administrative  inquiry  into  the  incident.  She  concluded  that  no
loss,  compromise,  or  suspected  compromise  of  classified  information  was  presumed
because no unauthorized individuals had been present, and no suspicious activity had
occurred during the 15 minutes that the safe was unsecured and unattended. Applicant
was  issued  a  written  warning  and  required  to  attend  a  closed-area  security  briefing
where he was re-educated on the requirements for safeguarding classified information.
(GEs  2,  4,  6;  Tr.  59-60.)  The  incident  was  reported  to  the  DOD  CAF  by  Applicant’s
employer. (GE 2.)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  informed  his  then  supervisor  that  he  could  no  longer
handle  the  stress  of  being  the  COMSEC  manager,  given  the  volume  of  COMSEC
material  and  having  only  one  other  employee,  the  alternate  COMSEC  manager,  to
assist  him.  After  an  internal  audit  by  a  COMSEC  specialist  from  another  facility,  who
questioned  why  COMSEC  responsibilities  were  being  handled  by  the  engineering
department  when  accounting  for  COMSEC  was  a  security  function  in  the  company’s
other facilities, Applicant’s employer decided to transfer COMSEC responsibilities from
the  engineering  department  to  the  security  department,  and  to  increase  the  staff
handling  COMSEC  duties.  (Tr.  40-42,  64,  72.)  It  took  the  company  several  months  to
assign  a  COMSEC  manager,  and  a  few  more  months  to  hire  two  more  COMSEC
employees before Applicant was relieved of his COMSEC responsibilities. (Tr. 83-84.)
In  September  2017,  Applicant  informed  his  FSO  that  he  could  not  locate  a
Secret-controlled cryptographic item that was within his accountability. He had recently
conducted  an  inventory  of  approximately  1,300  items  of  COMSEC  material  in  August
2017,  in  preparation  for  an  audit  by  a  U.S.  government  agency,  and  was  unable  to
account for an item from a high-volume COMSEC account. During an investigation into
the  violation  by  company  security  personnel,  it  was  discovered  that  the  item  had  not
been sighted during any of four previous semi-annual inventories that had been signed
off  by  Applicant  and  the  alternate  COMSEC  custodian.  Applicant  was  required  to
physically  touch  all  pieces  of  COMSEC  hardware  during  semi-annual  inventories.  (Tr.
42.) He knew that the Secret cryptographic item had last been seen in  February 2015.
(GEs  2,  5-6;  AE  C;  Tr.  61-62.)  However,  he  continued  to  believe  that  the  item  was
somewhere in the COMSEC room because he had a receipt indicating that it had been
returned to COMSEC accountability. (GEs 2, 5; Tr. 49.) He was determined to find the
piece  of  equipment,  which  was  about  one  square  inch  in  size  and  part  of  a  “split
encryption  key”  that  requires  mating  to  the  second  half  of  the  key  to  load  operational
software.  As  part  of  a  unique  electronic  system,  it  alone  is  useless  in  revealing  any
classified  information.  (Tr.  50-51.)    He  did  not  want  to  be  the  first  employee  to  lose  a
classified  item  at  his  worksite,  and  so  he  continued  to  search  for  the  item  without
success. (Tr. 51.) Applicant was verbally reprimanded by his supervisor, but he was not
otherwise disciplined for the violation. (GE 6, Tr. 63, 92.) In reporting the incident to the
DOD CAF in late September 2017, Applicant’s employer indicated that Applicant was in
the  process  of  being  removed  as  the  COMSEC  custodian  because  the  COMSEC
organization was being transitioned to a function of the security department. (GE 2.)
On  October  25,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  In  response  to  an  inquiry
concerning whether he had received a written warning, or been officially reprimanded or
disciplined  for  misconduct  in  the  workplace,  such  as  a  security  violation,  in  the  last
seven years, Applicant indicated that he had been disciplined or warned in May 2017 for
“1)  Security  violation  (unsecure  container)  [and]  2)  COMSEC  account  (missing  an
accountable item).” (GE 1.)
Following  the  transition  of  COMSEC  custodian  responsibilities  to  the  facility’s
security department in December 2017, Applicant began training to assume a position
as  a  logistics  planner.  In  evaluating  Applicant’s  job  performance  for  2017,  his  now
former supervisor indicated that the engineering team, program office, and management
are  indebted  to  Applicant  for  all  the  late  nights  and  weekends  he  spent  as  COMSEC
custodian to ensure the success of programs. (AE C.) The supervisor made no mention
of  the  security  infractions  in  Applicant’s  performance  evaluation.  He  discussed  the
incidents  with  Applicant,  who  realized  his  mistakes,  and  the  supervisor  “knew  that  it
wasn’t going to be a systemic problem.” (Tr. 91.) In January 2018, Applicant filled in for
the facility’s COMSEC team with no adverse incidents while the team received training
offsite. (AE B; Tr. 104.)
On February 5, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  about  the  two  security  violations  in  2017.  He
attributed  his  failure  to  spin  the  lock  on  a  classified  container  to  being  in  a  hurry.
Concerning  the  loss  of  a  Secret  accountable  item,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  did  not
immediately  report  that  an  item  was  missing  because  he  thought  it  would  be
irresponsible  of  him  to  report  the  loss  before  he  had  an  opportunity  to  look  for  it.  He
expressed  his  belief  that  it  was  lost  during  an  NSA  audit  in  August  2017  (GE  6),
although  he  now  admits  that  he  knew  it  was  missing for some  two  years.  (Tr. 62.) He
explained that it was a small item, approximately the size of a USB plug, and so could
have slipped through a crack. Applicant indicated that he did not lose his clearance or
his access, and he did not receive a written reprimand. Applicant did not recall any other
security violations. (GE 6.)
On  April  25,  2018,  Applicant  was  re-interviewed  by  the  OPM  investigator  and
confronted with the details of his August 2013 violation regarding his failure to spin the
X-09 lock at the end of the day. Applicant attributed the security infraction to being in a
rush  and  distracted  by  work  demands.  Applicant  explained  that  he  no  longer  had
COMSEC  custodian  duties  as  of  February  2018,  and  he  now  feels  more  comfortable
and  less  stressed  with  his  current  level  of  responsibility  for  classified  information.  (GE
6.)
In  his  current  position,  Applicant  no  longer  has  any  access  to  any  containers
approved for classified storage. He no longer works in the COMSEC storage room and
does not have regular access to classified information. (Tr. 69.) His current job function
requires  that  he  maintain  a  Secret  clearance.  (Tr.  101.)  He  understands  the  concern
about the failure to timely report the missing COMSEC item and acknowledges that he
should have reported it when he first could not find it. (Tr. 108.)
Character references
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  1999  through  2017  testified  for  Applicant  and  also
provided a character reference letter. (AE H.) This supervisor retired from the company
in  August  2018,  after  41  years  of  service  for  the  company.  (Tr.  71.)  Throughout  their
more  than  30  years  as  co-workers,  Applicant  has  been  a  reliable  and  trustworthy
employee.  Applicant’s  former  supervisor  attests  that  Applicant  was  promoted  to
COMSEC  custodian  in  2014  because  of  his  consistent  high  level  of  performance  as
alternate  COMSEC  custodian  starting  in  2010.  While  holding  COMSEC  custodian
responsibilities,  the  company  had  several  audits  by  their  U.S.  government  customers
and  by  internal  company  security  personnel,  all  with  favorable  results.  Applicant’s
former supervisor considers Applicant to be one of the most security conscious people
he has known. (AE H.) At Applicant’s hearing the supervisor testified that the COMSEC
room was a “very, very stressful area.” (Tr. 75-76, 86.) Twelve different programs were
“constantly under the gun, as far as time constraints and getting the work done to meet
the obligations of the contract[s]” (Tr. 76), and the COMSEC area was understaffed. (Tr.
81.) Regarding the transition of the COMSEC functions to the security department, the
supervisor  explained  that  their  employer  had  an  internal  audit  from  a  COMSEC
specialist from another of the company’s facilities, who questioned why engineering was
in charge of COMSEC responsibilities. (Tr. 80-81.) He added that the company wanted
Applicant to retain COMSEC duties as part of the security department. Applicant elected
to move to engineering support. (Tr. 82.) In the supervisor’s experience, Applicant took
his  accountability  and  security  responsibilities  very  seriously.  (Tr.  87.)  The  supervisor
believes the violations in 2017 occurred because of Applicant’s “tremendous” workload.
The  security  infractions  did  not  shake  his  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to  protect
classified  information.  (Tr.  88-89.)  He  blames  himself  for  not  paying  more  attention  to
the work demands placed on Applicant as COMSEC custodian. (Tr. 86.)
Applicant’s current supervisor has worked for the defense contractor for some 34
years.  He  transferred  to  Applicant’s  worksite  21  years  ago  and  has  known  him  since
that time. He was one of 12 test directors in their secure building. They “heavily taxed”
Applicant  in  the  COMSEC  room  to  maintain  their  programs.  (Tr.  96-97.)  Applicant’s
current  supervisor  knows  of  no  one  he  would  trust  more  with  national  security
information than Applicant, who has shown him “nothing but respect, tremendous care,
responsibility and [met] all of the, you know, proper traits of just a terrific employee.” (Tr.
99.)  Applicant’s  current  supervisor  corroborated  the  significant  increase  in  COMSEC
work between 2014 and 2017, as the company doubled the number of large programs
from  6  to  12  during  that  time.  He  considers  it  responsible  of  Applicant  to  have
approached his then supervisor in 2017 and told him that the job was “just too stressful.”
(Tr.  100.)  Applicant’s  current  supervisor  is  aware  of  Applicant’s  security  violations  in
2017. He has confidence in Applicant’s ability to handle classified information. (Tr. 102.)
A co-worker, who has known Applicant for some 25 years, respects Applicant for
the seriousness and attention to detail he brings to his work. He described Applicant as
a “model employee,” who leads by example. (AE G.)
Another  co-worker,  who  interacted  with  Applicant  on  a  daily  basis  during
Applicant’s tenure as chief COMSEC custodian at their test site, knows Applicant as a
golf partner outside of work. He has always found Applicant to have strong family values
and to be “a very upright, honest, and affable person.” (AE I.)
In December 2018, Applicant was recognized by his peers and leadership for his
outstanding  technical  contributions  in  2018.  He  was  promoted,  his  official  title  was
changed  to  include  “With  Honors,”  and  he  was  given  a  $1,500  cash  award  by  his
employer.  (AE  A;  Tr.  99.)  In  evaluating  Applicant’s  annual  performance  for  2018  in
March  2019,  Applicant’s  current  supervisor  described  Applicant’s  work  ethic  and
commitment to the job as “second to none.” Applicant was thorough and competent in
taking on new roles, and he took complete ownership of his tasks. (AE B.)

"Applicant,  55,  has  worked  for  her employer  (Company  A),  a  federal  contracting
company  since  1991.  She  was  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  2004.  Her
eligibility  was  renewed  after  a  2014  periodic  reinvestigation.  In  September  2017,
Applicant’s employer filed an incident report in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System
(JPAS),  alerting  the  DOD  CAF  that  Applicant  mishandled  Company  A  proprietary
information. This incident is the basis of the SOR.
After receiving an allegation of misconduct against Applicant, Company A began
an  investigation  into  her  use  of  their  IT  system.  The  investigation  determined  that
between  December  2016  and  September  2017,  Applicant  downloaded  over  150,000
files  onto  five  personal  storage  devices.  The  investigation  established  that  Applicant
was up to date on Company A training regarding the handling and storage of proprietary
information. The investigation also established that Applicant acted in knowing violation
of company policy.
An audit of Applicant’s activity showed that she initiated at least 23 copy events
from  the  Company  A  network  between  December  2016  and  September  2017.  She
admits downloading an unspecified number of files in December 2016, so that she could
continue to work during her end-of-year break when the Company A network would not
be available to her. In April 2017, Applicant learned that she would be laid off from her
position  in  Group  1  within  the  following  60  days.  In  May  2017,  Applicant  initiated  14
download events, copying over 59,000 files onto personal storage devices. She claims
that  she  need  the  files  to  help  her  colleagues  in  Group  1  as  needed.  She  also  claims
that she began working for Group 2 on a temporary basis in May 2017.
Applicant  considered  her  transition  from  Group  1  to  Group  2  difficult;  as  it
required  her  to  surrender  the  computers  she  used  in  her  Group  1  position  and  obtain
new computers for her position in Group 2. Transferring the files she needed between
her  old  and  new  computers  in  accordance  with  Company  A  policy  was  also  time
consuming. In the interest of convenience, Applicant decided to download the files she
needed to personal storage devices. She did not want to trouble her new supervisor in
Group 2 with the details of the file transfers. She was more focused on impressing him
with  her  performance  during  her  probationary  period.  Although  the  investigation
information  until
determined
September 2017, it does not specify the number of files she downloaded between June
and September 2017, or Applicant’s reasons for doing so.
that  Applicant  continued  downloading  proprietary
During the investigation, Company A interviewed Applicant’s Group 1 and Group
2  supervisors  and  had  them  review  the  list  of  the  files  Applicant  downloaded.  Neither
could  identify  a  legitimate  reason  for Applicant  to  have  possession  of  the  downloaded
files. According to Applicant’s Group 2 supervisor, Applicant did not join the group until
June 2017. Her position was not related to the position she previously held in Group 1
and did not require the use of any data from Group 1. According to Applicant’s Group 1
supervisor,  Applicant  was  not  expected  to  continue  working  on  Group  1  projects  after
she began her position in Group 2.
Applicant  returned  four  of  the  five  storage  devices  containing  the  downloaded
files to Company A in September 2017. She could not find the fifth device, but promised
to surrender if she was able to find it. She claims that she did not disclose the data to
anyone  outside  Company  A.  Ultimately,  the  investigation  concluded  that  Applicant  did
not  adhere  to  the  expected  behavior  of  Company  A  employees  when  she  copied
Company  A  proprietary  information  on  external  storage  devices.  She  received  a
warning  letter  reminding  her  of  her  obligation  to  protect  Company  A  proprietary
information and to adhere to Company A policies regarding the handling and protecting
proprietary information. She was warned that another violation could result in correction
action, up to and including discharge from Company A.
Character letters from Applicant’s current Group 2 supervisor and other longtime
coworkers  describe  her  as  trustworthy.  They  ascribe  Applicant’s  actions  to  a
misunderstanding of Company A policy.

"The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  K  that,  in  about  April  2016,  Applicant  was
found  culpable  by  his  employer  for  the  improper  shipment/unauthorized  export  of
classified hardware in 2013 from his employer to a foreign country (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that,
in about May 2016, he was found culpable by his employer for placing a purchase order
with  a  foreign  supplier  per  the  direction  of  the  lead  engineer  without  verifying  that  a
contractual  relationship  outlining  security  procedures  was  in  place  (SOR  ¶  1.b). When
he  answered  the  SOR  allegations,  Applicant  admitted  his  role  in  the  violations.  He
provided  a  detailed  response  in  which  he  attributed  the  violations  to  his  failure  to
validate  information  provided  by  the  program  engineer  manager,  who  had  given  him
“incorrect  or  overly  broad  advice.”  Applicant  detailed  steps  taken  to  address  the
systemic  issues  and  knowledge  gaps  within  his  company  that  contributed  to  the
violations. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old married father with two daughters, ages 21 and 20. He
has a bachelor’s degree awarded in June 1989. He has worked for his employer since
college. He has held his current Secret clearance since June 2004. He received annual
security trainings to as recently as January 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 40-43.)
A  violation  of  the  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulation  (ITAR)  prompted
Applicant’s employer to have an independent party review all shipments in the previous
five years involving a technical program (program). The review discovered two security
violations involving the program for which Applicant and an engineering manager in the
program management  office  (engineer  X)  were  deemed  culpable. The  details of  those
violations are as follows.
The  first  violation  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  involved  the  shipment  of  classified  hardware  as
unclassified  to  a foreign  military  in  2013.  In  February  2011,  a  foreign  military  placed a
“replenishment spares order” (RSO) for ten units of a part that was identified in the RSO
as  Confidential.  A  supply  chain  manager,  Applicant  processed  the  order  for  his
employer.  He  identified  an  authorized  supplier,  who  requested  the  classified  drawing
needed to build the part. In March 2011, the then lead engineer on the program notified
Applicant  and  three  export/import  (EX/IM)  managers  that  there  was  no  license
authorizing  the  export  of  the  classified  hardware  to  the  foreign  country,  and  that
shipment  of  the  parts  was  dependent  on  approval  of  a  DSP-85  export  license  for
classified material. The export license was approved in early June 2011. (GE 2; Tr. 45-
46.)
In  November  2012,  the  manufacturer  sent  ten  units  of  the  hardware  to  a
company  approved  for  off-site  storage  and  shipping  (shipping  agent)  of  the  program’s
repair  and  return  hardware.  After  nine  of  the  ten  units  failed  an  onsite  inspection  by
Applicant’s  employer,  the  hardware  was  returned  to  the  manufacturer  for  repair.  The
repaired  parts  were  received  by  the  shipping  agent  in  early  December  2012.  In  mid-
January 2013, the shipping agent notified Applicant and a procurement specialist, who
as  a  subordinate  assisted  Applicant  in  export  control  matters,  that  it  would  export  the
parts under the export license to the attention of the security officer. Two days later, on
Applicant’s  order,  Applicant’s  assistant  notified  the  shipping  agent  that  the  hardware
was not classified, so the shipment should be marked for the supply department. In mid-
February  2013,  the  ten  units  were  exported  as  unclassified  hardware  by  the  shipping
agent  to  the  foreign  military,  who  received  the  parts,  but  did  not  alert  Applicant’s
employer about the improper shipment. (GE 2; Tr. 46-48.)
Applicant  was  interviewed  on  March  3,  2016,  about  the  shipment  during  an
administrative  inquiry  by  his  employer  into  the  violation.  Applicant  explained  that  the
program  team  was  aware  the  parts  were  classified  when  the  purchase  order  was
placed. However, in late 2012, he had a discussion with engineer X, who was new to his
position  in  the  program  management  office  and  was  the  authorization  official  for  the
purchase  order.  Applicant  indicated  that  engineer  X  told  him  that  the  part  was  not
classified  in  a  steady  state,  but  that  the  frequency  data  inputted  during  testing  was
classified,  so  it  then  became  a  classified  part.  He  and  engineer  X  jointly  decided  that
because the part would be shipped in a steady state without the frequency data, it was
not classified. (GE 2; Tr. 34, 49-50.) Applicant relied on engineer X, who had been the
quality  inspection  manager  and  had  more  expertise  about  the  hardware.  (Tr.  51-52.)
Applicant acknowledged during his employer’s administrative inquiry that he had told his
assistant to  notify  the shipping  agent  to  ship  the  order  as  unclassified.  (GE  2;  Tr. 52.)
Applicant and the lead engineer were deemed culpable for causing a security violation
in  that  the  classified  hardware  was  not  shipped  in  accord  with  the  marking  and
packaging  requirements  of  the  National  Industrial  Security  Program  Operating  Manual
(NISPOM),  DOD  5220.22-M.  They  also  committed  an  ITAR  violation  because  the
hardware  was  shipped  under  a  DSP-5  export  license  for  unclassified  parts  and  not  a
DSP-85 export license for classified parts. (Tr. 52.) Applicant’s employer concluded that
because  the  classified  parts  were  not  properly  marked  or  packaged,  the  parts  were
vulnerable  to  unauthorized  disclosure  for  the  duration  of  the  shipment,  which  was
approximately 16 days, and that compromise was suspected. (GE 2; Tr. 53.) Applicant
now  understands  that  he  should  have  sought  additional  guidance  to  verify  the
classification level for the parts. (Tr. 50-51.)
The  second  violation  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  involved  the  placement  of  an  order  for
classified parts with a foreign supplier without the proper security agreements. In June
2014,  engineer X  sent  an  email  to  Applicant  that a Technical  Assist  Agreement  (TAA)
with the foreign supplier allowed for the procurement of “pretty much anything classified
or unclassified.” (AEs A-B; Tr. 54.) The TAA itself provided that “[c]lassified information
and material generated under this agreement must be assigned a security classification
as  specified  by  the  separate  contract(s)  security  classification  specifications  provided
with  the  contract(s).”  (GE  2.)  Under  the  TAA,  the  foreign  supplier  was  specifically
authorized  to  produce  unclassified  electromechanical  parts and assembly  components
for  the  system.  (GE  2.)  Acting  on  the  advice  of  engineer  X,  who  as  “Authorization
Owner”  for  program  licenses  served  as  liaison  between  the  EX/IM  staff  and  the
program,  Applicant  placed  a  purchase  order  by  email  with  the  foreign  supplier  for  ten
units  each  of  two  parts  that  were  classified  as  Confidential.  (GE  2;  AE  B;  Tr.  26,  56.)
The  purchase  order  contained  a  mix  of  classified  and  non-classified  line  items.
Applicant  identified  those  parts  which  were  classified  on  the  purchase  order.  (AE  A.)
The purchase order indicated in the header “Classified Items Exist: No.” However, in the
details  about  the  order,  Applicant  noted  “L/I  10  and  20  MUST  BE  MARKED  AS
CLASSIFIED.”  (AE  B;  Tr.  27.)  Before  placing  the  order,  Applicant  was  responsible  for
ensuring  that  there  was  a  current  Contract  Security  Specification  (a  DD  254)  or  a
Security  Aspects  Letter,  which  was  utilized  by  the  company  for  classified  production
with  foreign  vendors  without  a  DD  254.  Applicant  did  not  review  the  TAA  and  did  not
verify  that  a  contractual  relationship  outlining  security  procedures  was  in  place.  There
was no DD 254 or Security Aspects Letter for the foreign supplier. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 26-27,
59.)  Applicant  understands that  he  should  have  sought  clarification  or validation  about
the  scope  of  the  procurement  authorization.  (Tr.  55.)  He  cites  the  low  volume  of
classified purchase orders placed by him as a factor in his failure to ensure that there
was a DD 254 for the vendor. (Tr. 58.)
The  classified  parts  were  to  be  imported  for  inspection  by  Applicant’s  employer
before  being  exported.  Four  days  after  Applicant  placed  the  purchase  order,  he
received  shipping  instructions  and  an  import  control  worksheet  from  his  employer’s
EX/IM office. The import control worksheet did not include a space to identify the items
as classified.  Applicant was instructed that the material should be imported on an “ATF”
exemption rather than on a DSP-85 license issued for classified material. (Tr. 28.) The
import  control  worksheet  listed  the  TAA  as  the  document  authorizing  the  import.  The
shipping instructions did not include any handling instructions for classified material. (AE
B.)
At  the  request of  the EX/IM  official assigned  the  purchase order, on  January  6,
2015,  Applicant  gave  the  EX/IM  office  a  separate  material  classification  worksheet  for
each  classified  part.  Those  worksheets  were  required  to  import  the  parts  from  the
foreign supplier. On each worksheet, the classified part was identified as “Classified” as
to  the  security  classification  of  the  product.  The  following  day,  Engineer  X  advised
Applicant that their export license compliance manager had said “it is OK to import the
two classified and the other unclassified line items against [the TAA].” (AE B; Tr. 29.)
On  January  26,  2015,  the  foreign  supplier  notified  Applicant  and  one  of
Applicant’s  co-workers  (a  buyer)  that  “[a]ll  20  items  are  marked  as  classified  on  their
individual boxes and are packed in a crate, which was shipped on Friday.” (AE B.) On
February  3,  2015,  new  inventory  control  worksheets  were  issued  for  EX/IM  officials,
which  again  listed  the  TAA  as  the  import  authorization.  On  February  11,  2015,  the
EX/IM  official  managing  the  purchase  order  advised  engineer  X  and  a  procurement
specialist in Applicant’s office that if the items were to be imported only temporarily and
then shipped right back out, they “should have come in on a DSP61.” (AE B.)
The  crate  containing  both  classified  and  unclassified  hardware  was  sent  by
unsecured means from the foreign supplier to Applicant’s employer. (GE 2; AEs A-B; Tr.
59.) Approximately one month later, Applicant had no information that the shipment had
cleared U.S. customs, so he alerted the warehouse about the shipment. He indicated in
his  email  that  shipments  would  soon  be  in  transit  to  the  warehouse,  including  some
classified items; that multiple shipments shipped from the foreign vendor were currently
in U.S. customs; and that, for the items that are classified, “they will be identified with a
label on individual boxes inside the crate.” (AE B.) Applicant  wanted to ensure that the
warehouse was aware of the need to segregate and secure the classified hardware. On
March  3,  2015,  Applicant  received  a  status  report from  the  warehouse  that  did  not  list
the  classified  shipment.  (Tr.  31.)  Concerned  because  the  shipment  should  have  been
received  by  then,  Applicant  asked  the  warehouse  for  proof  of  the  shipment’s  delivery.
The  freight  forwarder  showed  that  the  shipment  was  received  in  the  warehouse  on
February  16,  2015.  After  Applicant  provided  proof  of  delivery  to  the  warehouse,  the
shipment  was  located  and  the  classified  material,  which  was  marked  as  Confidential,
was then properly segregated and secured. (GE 2; AEs A-B; Tr. 31-32, 60.)
When  questioned  in  January  2016  about  his  role  in  the  security  violation,
engineer X asserted that he was told by the export license compliance manager that he
could order classified parts from the foreign supplier under the existing TAA. When the
compliance manager was interviewed, she stated that she more likely told  him that the
agreement  had  a  classified  component  or  element,  but  that  he  should  read  the
agreement  and  validate  it  himself,  and  contact  the  EX/IM  official  assigned  the  matter.
Engineer X  never contacted the EX/IM  official on  the TAA.  As  a  result  of his incorrect
translation  of  the  TAA  and  his  directions  to  Applicant,  the  classified  parts  were  not
properly shipped. They were vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure for about four days
while  in  transit  and  for  approximately  two  weeks  while  unsecured  in  the  warehouse.
Applicant  was  deemed  culpable  by  his  employer  for  failing  to  ensure  that  there  was  a
current  contract  security  classification  specification  or  Security  Aspects  Letter  with  the
foreign vendor. The foreign vendor held a NATO Secret facility clearance, but the lack
of  proper security  classification  guidance  raised  questions about the methods  used by
the  foreign  vendor  for  the  protection  of  classified  information  within  its  control.
Compromise was suspected because it could not be ruled out. (GE 2; AE A.)
Neither  Applicant  nor  engineer  X  had  any  previous  security  infractions  on  their
records.  For  his  role  in  the  security  violations,  Applicant  received  a  two-week  unpaid
suspension from work, which was consistent with his employer’s published disciplinary
process.  He  was  also  ineligible  for  supplemental  compensation  (merit  pay)  from  his
employer  in  2017.  Applicant  was  reeducated  on  the  importance  of  safeguarding
classified  information.  (GEs  2-3;  Tr.  44.)  His  security  violations  were  reported  to  the
DOD on June 3, 2016. (GE 3.)
Applicant  immediately  set  out  on  March  3,  2016,  to  establish  a  procurement
procedure to ensure that classified purchase orders would be properly marked. Among
the  procedures,  he  established  that,  on  receipt  of  a  classified  customer  requisition
order,  supply  chain  management  would  identify  a  supply  source  and  then  make  a  DD
254 determination. Requisitions from the program management office would include in
the  request  the  classification  for  the  material.  Purchase  orders  would  be  required  to
state “Yes” in the header for “Classified Items Exist,” and the buyer would have to note
in  the  header  that  a  DD  254  is  required,  and  to  add  in  the  text  of  the  purchase  order
“The  PN  for  this  PO  is  CLASSIFIED.  Department  of  Defense  contract  security
classification  specification,  DD  form  254  has  been  forwarded  under  separate  cover.”
(AEs  A,  C.)  His  employer  improved  its  processes  to  ensure  that  classified  purchase
in  compliance  with  regulations.  License
orders  and  shipments  are  executed
authorization authority moved from the program management office to an EX/IM role. All
company  technical  information/services  and  material  orders  are  now  vetted  to
determine whether a U.S. export or import authorization or license is required from the
U.S.  State  Department  or  U.S.  Commerce  Department.  Checks  were  established  to
ensure that new orders are compliant with the authorization. To avoid any ambiguity, for
the  two  systems  in  his  supply  chain  accountability,  Applicant  had  all  the  classified
material listed in the security classification guidance (SCG) for the systems entered into
a  material-tracking  database  against  which  any  new  order  is  matched.  If  an  item  is
flagged in the database, it is treated as classified. (AE A; Tr. 35-37.) His employer also
instituted  a  transportation  plan,  and  Applicant  set  up  a  process  to  track  the
transportation of any classified material. (Tr. 32-33, 39.)
Applicant  completed  more
than  40  hours  of  security  authorization  and
export/import  training  after the  violations  were  discovered  in  2016.  (Tr.  44.)  As  of  May
2019, he had issued two classified purchase orders and managed or participated in nine
classified  shipments  since  the  violations.  (AE  A;  Tr.  61.)  There  is  no  evidence  that  he
failed  to  comply  with  his  company’s  procedures  or  NISPOM  requirements  in  those
instances. (AE A; Tr. 40.) He sought guidance from his employer’s security staff before
initiating any purchase order or equipment. (Tr. 61.) In 2019, Applicant was recognized
by his employer for his trustworthiness.  He has a reputation for always doing the right
thing for his company and for maintaining open and honest dialog with leadership and
customers. (AE D.)

"Applicant is a 44-year-old married woman. She graduated from college in 1997 and
earned a master’s degree in 2007. (Tr. 49) She has worked for various federal contractors
since 2006. She currently is a data scientist. (Tr. 32)  She has held a security clearance
since 2006. (Tr. 55)
Applicant is highly respected on the job. According to her supervisor, she is unique
because she understands all of the technology that her company utilizes at an expert level.
(Tr. 70) Moreover, she is highly security conscious, as she is typically the employee who
asks  if  everyone  has  the  necessary  clearances  before  engaging  in  conversations  with
clients. (Tr. 71)
In March 2015, towards the end of a contract, Applicant and her coworkers were
instructed to clean out their work areas, pack their belongings and telework until the next
project started. Applicant complied with this directive, packing her personal belongings in a
box and taking them home. (Tr. 37)
About three weeks later, in April 2015, Applicant realized that she had inadvertently
taken  a  classified  CD  home.  (Tr.  37,  63)  She  immediately  rendered  it  inoperable  by
scratching it and breaking it into several pieces. (Tr. 36). She stored the broken, inoperable
CD  in  a  box  in  her  garage  until  approximately  September  2015,  after  her  employer
regained access to the sensitive compartmented information facility. (Tr. 65) She then
returned it to the SCIF, but did not inform the facility security office that she had removed it.
Her  failure  to  report  the  return  of  the  classified  pieces  of  the  CD  stemmed  from  a
combination of fear,  procrastination, and the prioritization of project work over security
consciousness. (GE B at 3; Tr. 37) Specifically, when she initially returned the CD, she did
not want to take the time to report it to the facility security officer because the process was
time-consuming, and she preferred to spend her time completing a project. (Tr. 38)  She
ultimately  disclosed  the  information  about  the  CD  during  a  polygraph  examination  in
September 2016. (Tr. 38)

"Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b and denied the allegations in SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. (Answer; Tr.
at 12-15; GE 1)
Applicant is 26 years old. She graduated from high school in 2012. She attended
some  college  but  had  not  yet  earned a  degree.  She  previously  worked  for  three  DOD
contractors  between approximately 2014 and  2017. As of  the date  of  the hearing,  she
worked in accounting for a private company. She has  never held a security clearance.
Her  offer  of  employment  from  another  DOD  contractor  was  contingent  on  obtaining  a
clearance. (Tr. at 7-10, 30-33; GE 1, 2)
The SOR alleges  that Applicant failed to follow required security procedures for
the protection of classified information in April 2017, when she allowed an unauthorized
individual: (1) access to a secure building, (2) access behind the security desk through a
security bypass door, and (3) use of a secure computer terminal in direct violation of client
contract requirements (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b). The SOR also alleges that she was terminated
for cause from her employment as a security officer in April 2017, after allowing the above-
mentioned unauthorized individual use of a secure computer terminal (SOR ¶ 2.a). The
SOR also alleges that she was terminated from employment in August 2017, as a security
officer with another employer, for improper conduct (SOR ¶ 2.b).
Applicant  first  became  a  security  officer  in  approximately  2015,  at  age  21.  She
worked as a “floater” and was assigned to various sites as needed. In April 2017, at age
23, she worked at a site for which she had just been assigned two months prior. She had
just completed training. While assisting an employee, another individual approached the
security  bypass  door  and  informed  Applicant  that  she  needed  a  replacement  badge.
Applicant obtained the individual’s identification card and verified on the computer system
that  the  individual  was  an  employee.  Applicant  then  obtained  approval,  from  another
experienced security officer on duty, to escort the individual through the security bypass
door and to the security desk so that Applicant could issue the individual a badge. When
Applicant  tried  to  further  verify  the  individual’s  credentials  on  the  computer  system,
Applicant repeatedly mistyped the individual’s name. When the individual offered to help,
Applicant  placed  the  keyboard  on  the  upper  level  of  the  security  desk  to  allow  the
individual  to  type  in  her  own  information.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  should  not
have  done  this.  Upon  locating  the  individual’s  credentials,  the  individual  subsequently
began  to  walk  behind  the  security  desk  so  that  she  could  see  the  information  on
Applicant’s  computer  screen.  Applicant  told  her  to  stop,  at  which  point  the  individual
returned  to  the  front  of  the  security  desk.  Applicant  then  proceeded  with  issuing  the
individual her badge. (Tr. at 24-44, 51-64, 66-77; GE 1-3; AE A)
When Applicant reported to work the following day, two  on-duty security officers
told her that she no longer worked there. She did not receive a response when she texted
her supervisor to ask what was going on. After several days, she reported to the office as
instructed and was informed that she was terminated. Employment records reflect that
she was discharged for allowing an authorized individual use of a secure computer. She
denied responding, “No big deal.” She testified that she believed she did primarily as she
was  trained,  but  acknowledged  her  poor  judgment  in  permitting  the  unauthorized
individual to use her computer keyboard. (Tr. at 24-44, 51-64, 66-77; GE 1-3; AE A)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  had  previous  unfavorable  incidents  with  the
same  employer.  In  February  2016,  she  was  given  a  written  warning  for  violating  her
employer’s phone policy when she pulled out her phone while on duty. In April 2016, she
was given a written warning for tardiness. In June 2016, she was given a final warning for
abandoning her post after she could not find the device she needed to patrol the site. She
testified that she did so only after she unsuccessfully attempted to contact her supervisor
multiple times and consequently believed that her employer no longer had authority over
the site. In July 2016, she was verbally reprimanded for poor attendance. In January 2017,
she was verbally reprimanded for violating her employer’s uniform policy when she was
not in proper uniform while on duty. She testified that she understood the importance of
following her employer’s rules and regulations, even if she found them to be strict. (Tr. at
17, 27-29, 31, 44-64, 66-77; GE 1-3)
After working for another DOD contractor for approximately two months, Applicant
was terminated from employment as a security officer in August 2017, due to improper
conduct. She testified that she reported to work approximately 30 minutes late because
she had to change her car’s flat tire in the rain. She called her manager and her on-site
co-worker to report her tardiness. She was drenched upon arriving at work so she wrung
out her uniform and took off her shoes and socks in an effort to get dry. Her actions were
captured  on  camera  and  her  supervisor  notified  her  the  following  day  that  she  was
dismissed due to a consequent client complaint. She testified that she understood that
she  should  have  handled  her  discomfort  privately.  She  has  not  since  had  any  other
unfavorable  incidents  with  other  employers  and  testified  that  she  has  matured  and
learned from her mistakes. (Tr. at 28-31, 64-77; GE 1-2)

"Under Guideline K, the SOR alleged that in October 2015, Applicant emailed 37
documents  containing  sensitive  information from  her  work  email  to  her  personal email
accounts; that she  was suspended  during  her employer’s investigation  of  her conduct;
and that in November 2015, she was fired as a result of her actions (SOR 1.a). (FORM,
Item 1)
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the information in SOR 1.a (SOR 2.a).
It was further alleged that during her employer’s investigation into her actions, Applicant
intentionally  made  false  statements  in  an  attempt  to  minimize  the  true  scope  of  her
misconduct (SOR 2.b). (FORM, Item 1)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations,  all  of  the
allegations. (FORM, Item 3) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions,
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  senior  software  engineer  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  in  a  position  that  requires  a  security  clearance.  In  December  1987,  she
graduated  from  college  with  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  electrical  engineering.
Applicant  and  her  husband  have  been  married  since  August  1990  and  have  three
children, all now in their 20s. She has worked for her current employer (Company A) since
December 2015. Applicant previously worked as a senior systems engineer for a different
defense contractor (Company B) between March and November 2015. Between August
2013 and March 2015, Applicant worked as a software engineer for two companies not
involved  in  the  defense  industry.  She  first  received  a  security  clearance  in  2008  in
connection with her employment as a senior software engineer at a defense contractor
between May 2007 and April 2013. (FORM, Items 4 and 5)
In  e-QIP  Section  13A (Employment  Activities),  Applicant disclosed that she had
left  her  job  with  Company  A  “by  mutual  agreement”  due  to  “misconduct.”  During  the
ensuing background investigation, information was obtained that showed Applicant had
intentionally  sent  documents  containing  sensitive  information  to  her  personal  email
accounts.  Even  though  the  documents  were  not  classified,  most  were  proprietary
documents containing sensitive information about Company B’s development of systems
for its federal government customer. As such, company policy required that employees
protect those documents from unauthorized disclosure. Applicant was not authorized to
transmit  the  documents  in  question  outside  the  control  of  Company  B  information
systems. Available information further shows that Applicant actually was fired from her
Company B position rather than  leaving  “by mutual agreement.”  (FORM, Items 3, 4, 5,
and 7)
On October 14, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by Company B security officials,
who asked Applicant if she had sent sensitive or proprietary information to her personal
email.  At  first,  Applicant  was  evasive  about  her  actions,  admitting  to  sending  one
document. She  then  stated she  sent “a few” documents, then  “five” documents. At that
time,  after  giving  consent  to  search  her  Company  B  computer  and  employee  email
account,  Applicant  was  suspended  pending  completion  of  Company  B’s  investigation.
Ultimately, 37 documents were identified as having been transmitted between April and
October 2015 to four personal email accounts attributed to Applicant. She has claimed
that she was not truthful when interviewed because she felt intimidated by Company B
officials.  In  response  to  SOR  Guideline  E  allegations,  Applicant  claims  she  was  under
duress during the Company B interview. (FORM, Items 3, 5, and 7)
Concurrent with Company B’s investigation, the FBI also investigated Applicant’s
actions as possible economic espionage. The investigation lasted from October 2015 until
January 2016, closing after the  Department of  Justice declined prosecution. During an
interview with FBI agents on January 7, 2016, Applicant confirmed that she had deleted
from her email accounts, computer, and handheld devices, all of the files she had sent.
The FBI report of investigation further shows that Applicant was not truthful in October
2015, when she was first interviewed by Company B officials. In her response to the SOR,
Applicant claimed that the FBI agents informed her that Company B “did not handle this
incident correctly, and has blown this incident out of proportion.” Nothing in the FBI report
or any other portion of this record supports her claim. (FORM, Items 5 and 8)
On April 25, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part
of her background investigation. During that interview, Applicant stated that she did not
understand that the information she emailed to herself needed to be protected in much
the same way as information that was actually classified. Further, and as she also stated
in response to the SOR, Applicant averred that she had not received adequate training
regarding protection of sensitive information. Finally, Applicant characterized her actions
in sending 37 documents to her personal email accounts as “inadvertent.” (FORM, Items
3 and 5)
On   March   3,   2015,  when   she   first  began   working   at  Company  B,   Applicant
executed   a   “Confidentiality   and   Innovation   Agreement”  whereby   she   agreed   that  the
information  for  which  she  might  be  responsible  during  her  employment  was  sensitive,
proprietary information, the unauthorized disclosure of which would be contrary to internal
company policies and, potentially, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. At the outset of
her employment with Company B, Applicant also completed extensive training in matters
related to the protection of classified information as well as other sensitive and proprietary
information. In response to the SOR, Applicant claims there has been no recurrence of
this type of conduct since 2015. She further avers that Company A, for whom she now
works, has given her the training and resources she needs to perform her duties without
mishandling  sensitive  information.  Applicant  produced  information  that  shows  she  has
received numerous awards for her work at Company A; however, she did not provide any
information that would corroborate her claims regarding training and resources. (FORM,
Items 3, 6, and 7)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old and has worked for a major defense contractor as a cyber
security  engineer  since  September  2018.  After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant
studied  for  one  year  (July  2003-June  2004)  at  the  U.S.  Military  Academy  Preparatory
School, which is also known as West Point Prep. This education constituted active-duty
service in the Army. He did not continue his education at West Point and was honorably
discharged from the Army.  He earned a bachelor’s degree  in August 2007  and  began
working  for  a  major  defense  contractor  (E1)  in  November  2007  as  an  information
assurance  engineer.  He  also  continued  his studies  and  earned  two  master’s  degrees,
one in December 2013 and a second in April 2015, and a Ph.D. in March 2021. He was
first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  about  November  2007  and  has  continuously
maintained  his  eligibility.  He  has  lived  with  his  girlfriend  since  2017.  They  have  no
children. (Tr. at 20-21; GE 2 at 14; AE C.)
Applicant’s last day of work at E1 was August 30, 2018.  He had previously given
notice of his intent to resign his position at that company and had accepted a position with
his current employer (E2). In the afternoon of his last day of work, he downloaded over
15,000 files onto his personal USB external hard drive (USB Device), and when he left
the  employer’s  premises,  he  took  the  USB  Device  with  him.  On  September  4,  2018,
investigators  at  E1  were  alerted  to  this  unusual  downloading  activity  by  a  departing
employee and investigated the circumstances. (GE 3 at 1.)
The  investigators  found  that  the  file  path  for  the  downloaded  files  was  titled
“Personaldocs\[E1].” They issued  a  memorandum  to  Applicant  (the  E1  Memorandum),
dated September 6, 2018, even though he no longer worked there. Applicant signed the
E1 Memorandum the next day, acknowledging receipt, and returned it to the investigators.
In  the  E1  Memorandum,  the  investigators  advised  Applicant  that  he  had  violated  two
company  policies  set  forth  in  the  E1  Corporate  Information  Protection  Manual  by
connecting  his USB  Device to  E1’s information  network and  by  downloading files from
E1’s network onto his personal USB Device  without authorization. The two policies are
described in the E1 Memorandum  as follows:
1.   Section  106.6.7(1)  - titled Storage of Information on Personally Owned
Information Technology Assets; and
2.   Section  106.6.7(3)  -  titled Connectivity of Personally Owned Information
Technology Assets to [E1] Infrastructure.
The investigators instructed Applicant to return his USB Device to E1, which he did. They
advised him and sought his acknowledgment that E1 may delete E1 information from the
device and in the process may also delete Applicant’s information. In a separate internal
E1 memorandum, dated December 10, 2018, which was not shared with Applicant at that
time, the writer noted that the files recovered from his USB Device  numbered 15,179 with
a total amount of 8.7 gigabytes of data transferred from E1’s network to the USB Device.
The investigators compared that number of files with a full-year count of the number of
files Applicant would transfer in the performance of his work duties, which was 22,599.
This comparison highlighted the unusual nature of Applicant’s actions on the day he left
E1. (Tr. at 39, 66-68; GE 3 at 1-2.)
The  December  10,  2018  internal  memorandum  references  the  allegation  under
investigation as follows:
Allegation:   Data  Exfiltration  with  CI/CT  nexus  (SUBSTANTIATED)
(emphasis in original)
The   term   CI/CT   stands  for  Counterintelligence/Counter  Terrorism.  The   USB
Device was wiped  in its entirety  on  September 17, 2018.  The  memorandum  also
states:   “On  October 9,   2018,   Adverse  information   was  filed   against   [Applicant].”
(GE 3 at 1.)
In  his  August  2019  clearance  reinvestigation  background  interview,  Applicant
initially  denied  any  personal  history  of  misuse  of  any  information  technology  system,
including any non-compliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations. He was
then confronted by the background investigator with information from his E1 employment
records regarding his actions on August 30, 2018. Applicant was advised that as a result
of his actions on that date he was not eligible for rehire at E1. He testified at the hearing
that  he  learned  for  the  first  time  during  his background  interview  that  E1  regarded  his
actions as improper. Applicant admitted to the investigator that on his last day at E1, he
accidentally downloaded E1 proprietary information (E1PI) onto his USB Device when he
was hurriedly downloading his personal files onto his device that he wanted to take with
him. He explained that this happened because he had used his company’s laptop for both
work and personal purposes over his 11 years of working at E1. He said he downloaded
onto  the  E1  network  research  articles  that  he  read  for  his  own  education  as  well  as
information  related  to  his  doctoral  studies  when  he  was  pursuing  his  Ph.D.  as  well  as
information related to his master’s degrees prior to that. This information was downloaded
onto the same drive on the E1 network that he used for work-related activities. He claimed
that in his haste, he inadvertently downloaded E1PI along with his personal files. (Tr. at
39-40; GE 2 at 6-7.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  K  - The  SOR  sets  forth  a  single  allegation  under  this
guideline in which the Government alleges that Applicant deliberately downloaded E1PI
onto  his  USB  Device  in  August  2018  while  employed  by  E1.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
wrote that his actions were not deliberate. He wrote that he only intended to download his
educational materials related to his master’s degree studies as well as over two years of
his  studies  in  his  Ph.D.  program.  He  explained  that  his  E1  work  laptop  was  limited  to
unclassified information. In mitigation, he commented that he immediately complied with
the request of E1’s security manager to deliver the USB Device to the manager. He also
argued  that  his  actions  were  infrequent  and  the  result  of  inadequate  training  while  he
worked at E1.
Paragraph  2,  Guideline  M  - This  paragraph  of  the  SOR  cross-alleges  under
Guideline M the same facts alleged under Guideline K. In his Answer, Applicant admitted
the disqualifying facts, using the words “I accept” rather than “I admit.” In mitigation, he
noted  that  this  incident  occurred  nearly  three  years  earlier  and  no  similar  action  has
occurred.  He  also  commented  that  no  classified  information  was  copied  onto  his  USB
Device. He repeated that his actions were not intentional. He claimed that E1 permitted
data to be transferred between computer systems using external hard drives, though he
acknowledged that transferring E1PI to a personal mobile device was not authorized.
Paragraph 3, Guideline E – This paragraph also cross-alleges under Guideline E
the  facts  set  forth  under  Guideline  K.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  the  allegation.
However, his denial was based upon his mistaken belief that the Guideline E allegation
concerns a falsification in his SCA for his failure to disclose the August 30, 2018 security
incident. In fact, the SCA predated August 30, 2018, by three weeks. Instead, the cross-
allegation  concerns  the  incident  itself,  as  an  independent  personal  conduct  security
concern.
At the hearing, Applicant testified at length about the circumstances surrounding
the August 30, 2018 incident. He explained that E1 had two computer networks and that
on occasion information had to be transferred from one network to the other. Certain files
were so large that they could only be transferred by a USB  external hard drive device.
The administrative process to do this required the completion of a form by the employee
transferring the files. The form must be approved to authorize the employee to perform
transfers between networks. While performing his duties at E1, Applicant had submitted
this form and had permission to transfer files on a USB drive between the two networks.
Without  such   an   approval,  the   system   would  not  deny   him   access   to   the   company’s
network  when  he  plugged  in a  USB  hard drive. Applicant claimed  that  it was not necessary
to  use  a  company-issued  USB  device to  transfer files.  This testimony  is inconsistent with
the  E1  Memorandum,  which stated  that  Applicant had  violated  company  policy  prohibiting
the  connection  of a  personally  owned  device to  E1’s  technology  infrastructure.  (Tr.  at 22-
26; GE 3 at 2.)
Applicant further testified that he was required to use an external USB device only
for work-related information. He admitted that one mistake he made on August 30, 2018,
was  that  he  used  an  external  USB  device  to  transfer  his  personal  files.  That  required
getting permission from “IT.” He claimed he was unaware of that requirement at the time
he left the company. The form he had previously prepared to obtain permission to use an
external  USB  device  required  confirmation  that  the  permission  sought  was  to  perform
routine work-related activities. (Tr. at 26-28.)
A  complication  that  increased  the  risk  of  Applicant’s  actions  is  that  he  did  not
separate his personal files from his work files on his section of the E2 shared drive used
to  store  information.  Under  any  single  “parent  folder,”  he  would  have  subfolders
containing both personal and work files. He referred in his testimony to “a nested tree” of
parent  folders  and  sub-folders  with  further  sub-folders  and  even  more  sub-folders.  He
used a chronological approach to his filing system so that all of his activities  in a given
period, both work-related and personal, would be in that one main file, separated into sub-
folders. As a result, when he copied over to his USB Device a parent folder that he thought
had  his  academic  literature  as  well  as  personal  information,  such  as  tax  and  pay
information,  the  parent  folder  would  also  include  sub-folders  with  E1PI.  The  Windows
copying technology he used was simple “drag and drop,” so he dragged and copied file
folders that contained both work-related files and personal files. In that process, nothing
was removed from the E1 system, it was just copied. He did not review each folder to see
if it had only personal files. He was going through the process of  copying hundreds of
folders hastily over an hour or two at the end of his last workday at E1 before Labor Day
weekend. He agreed he made a mistake in how he handled the copying. Nevertheless,
he  testified  that  it  was  only  his  intent  to  copy  his  academic  and  personal  files.  He
purchased  the  USB  Device  about  a  week  earlier.  It  was  solely  for  the  purpose  of
transferring his files in connection with his change of employment. (Tr. at 28-31, 47-55,
71-74.)
Applicant also transferred files from his emails that included both personal emails
and work emails. He testified that E1 allowed personal use of its email system. Some of
the email files he copied may have been work-related. He believes that a large number
of the other files he transferred onto his USB Device were publicly available documents
that he was required to download periodically for work purposes. Those files  are large
and numerous. (Tr. 31-34.)
Applicant contends that with the permission he had to use portable USB devices
to transfer files for work-related purposes, he did not violate any company policies by his
actions on August 30, 2018. He does not believe he violated any policy by plugging his
USB Device into the E1’s network on that date. (Tr. at 76-77; GE 3 at 2.)
With  hindsight,  Applicant  now  realizes  that  he  should  have  talked  to  E1’s  IT
Department and explained what he wanted to do with his personal computer files, even
though he already had “USB access” approval. The day he left the company, he had an
exit interview in which he turned over all of his IT equipment. He had the opportunity then
to talk about his use of the personal USB Device, but the subject never came up since
his  actions  were  only  discovered  in  the  following  days.  His  job  at  E1  was  related  to
information security in connection with a specific DoD project. His new job at E2 was also
dealing with information security, but at the organization level. Nevertheless, he insisted
at the hearing that the information he claims he copied inadvertently would not be helpful
to him in his new position with E2. (Tr. at 61-65, 76-77.).
Other Mitigating  Evidence
When Applicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation, he claims
he  learned for the first time the seriousness of his actions when he left E1. He decided
to  take  actions  to  avoid  future  problems  like  this  one,  and  he  enrolled  in  a  cyber
awareness course provided by DoD in 2019 and again in 2021. He also teaches a course
in  cyber  security  at  a  local  university.  In  connection  with  that  experience,  he  further
educated himself on such matters. (Tr. at 39-45; AE D at 1-2.)
Applicant  testified  that  prior  to  the  August  2018  incident,  he  had  never  been
counseled or written up for being careless with information technology, nor has he had
any security issues since the incident. He testified that since he was instructed by E1’s
investigators in September 2018 to return the USB Device, he has been transparent with
everyone about the incident. (Tr. at 45-46.)
Applicant’s exit from E1 in 2018 was the first time he had ever gone through this
transition process. He had three weeks from the date of his new job offer from E2 to his
last day at E1. He had much to do, including a geographic relocation. He deferred the
copying process to his last day of work and performed it quickly in a limited amount of
time. He did not take the time to see what sub-folders were included in each folder he
copied  and  whether  the  folders  he  was  copying  contained  any  E1PI.  He  testified  that
throughout his 11 years at E1,  he was aware of E1’s rule that you cannot take E1PI when
you terminate your employment with the company. (Tr. at 55-56.)

"Applicant, age 33, earned a high school diploma in 2005. He has taken courses at
a  university  (University  A)  since  2012,  but  has  not  yet  earned  a  degree.  He  served
honorably  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  2006  through  2012.  He  was  employed  as  an
information assurance specialist by a defense contractor (Company A) from April 2018
until  July  2019;  and  as  a  cyber-information  assurance  analyst  by  another  defense
contractor (Company B) since July 2019. He held an active DOD security clearance while
employed by Company A, but the record did not otherwise indicate his security clearance
history while in the service or thereafter. Company B is sponsoring his pending security
clearance application. (Item 2, 4, 6; Item 5 at 4)
The SOR alleged under Guideline K (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.b), and cross alleged under
Guideline  M  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  –  2.b)  and  Guideline  E  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a  –  3.b),  that,  on  two
occasions  in  2019,  Applicant  downloaded  files  from  his  unclassified  work  computer  in
violation of Company A policy. Also under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant
falsified material facts regarding his file download activity during two different interviews
in 2019, one with a Company A investigator (SOR ¶ 3.c) and one with a DOD investigator
(SOR ¶ 3.d). Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 11 delinquent debts
totaling $48,087 (SOR ¶¶ 4.a – 4.k).
In   his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  responded   “I  admit”  to   the   facts  alleged   under
Guideline  K  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  –1.b),  which  were cross alleged  under  Guideline  M  (SOR ¶¶  2.a

accompanying  those  responses, Applicant denied  the  misconduct alleged  in SOR ¶  1.b.
(and  cross alleged  in SOR ¶¶  2.b  and  3.b). Thus, I have  construed  his admissions to  SOR
¶¶  1.b,  2.b, and  3.b  as denials. He   also   responded   “I admit” to   the  facts alleged  under
Guideline  F  (SOR ¶¶  4.a  –   4.k).  Regarding  Guideline  E, he  denied  the  facts alleged  in

On  June  20,  2019,  Applicant  downloaded  over  2,000  files  from  his  unclassified
work computer and transferred them to his personal universal serial bus (USB) drive. On
June 22, 2019, he informed Company A of his resignation and intent to begin employment
with Company B on July 22, 2019. On July 8, 2019, Company A discovered Applicant’s
high-volume file transfer and initiated an immediate investigation. (Items 6, 7)
Company A determined that the files contained on Applicant’s personal USB drive
included Company A proprietary information, third-party proprietary information (related
to  two  U.S.  government  programs  on  which  Applicant  was  contracted  to  work),  and
export-controlled  information  (as  designated  by  the  International  Traffic  in  Arms
Regulations (ITAR) and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)). Those files
were  marked  Company  A  Proprietary.  Company  A  concluded
that  Applicant’s
downloading and transfer of files to his personal USB drive was a deliberate attempt  to
obtain proprietary data for outside use, which was unauthorized and a direct violation of
the following Company A policies: 1) Code of Conduct and 2) Protection of Company A
and Third-Party Information. (Items 6, 7, 10, 11)
The investigation revealed no evidence that Applicant ever transferred those files
from  his  USB  drive  to  any  other  computer,  that  the  USB  drive  ever  left  his  personal
residence where it had been stored, that any classified data resided on the USB drive, or
that  Applicant  had  any  previous  security  incidents  on  his  record.  Nevertheless,  the
investigation concluded that Applicant’s behavior and actions, including false statements
he made during the investigation, were “Insider Threat Activity” and a risk to all Company
A  information  systems.  As  a  result,  on  July  8,  2019,  Company  A  expedited  his
employment separation, seized all of Applicant’s computing devices, removed his badge
access, escorted him off Company A’s property, and submitted an adverse statement in
the DOD personnel security clearance and access database. (Items 6, 7)
On  July  8,  2019,  after  Applicant  was  escorted  off  its  property,  Company  A
discovered  information  on  Applicant’s  seized  laptop  which  revealed  that  he  also
downloaded and transferred files from his unclassified work computer to eight computer
discs  on  July  2,  2019.  Company  A  determined  that  the  files  on  the  discs  contained
Company A cyber security-related tools and training, but did not provide the results of its
forensic investigation of the discs which was “in progress” as of July 12, 2019, the date
of  its  final  report  of  the  misconduct  for  which  Applicant’s  separation  was  expedited.
Neither the report nor any other record evidence indicated what, if any, conclusions that
investigation formed about the presence of classified information on the discs or whether
Applicant’s  actions  in  downloading  or  transferring  the  files  to  the  discs  violated  any
Company  A  policies  or  other  rules.  While  acknowledging  that  “there  is  currently  no
evidence that Applicant copied the discs for his own use and/or removed the discs from
[Company  A’]s  premises,”  the  Government  argued  in  its  FORM  that  Applicant’s  disc-
related file transfer activity remained relevant “for the concerns it potentially raises under
Guidelines K, M, and E.” (Item 7)
Applicant denied that his disc-related file transfer activity was either unauthorized
or  violated  any  policies  or  rules.  Given  the  timing  of  the  discovery,  Applicant  was  not
questioned about his disc-related file transfer activity during Company A’s investigation.
However,  he  addressed  it  during  his  December  2019  security  clearance  interview  (SI)
and in his SOR answer. During his SI, Applicant explained that he never copied any files
onto discs for his personal use and that his team regularly copied files onto discs in the
ordinary course of business. In his SOR answer, he provided more details about the file
transfer  and  reiterated  that  it  was  not  done  for  his  personal  use.  He  clarified  that  he
transferred  the files (which  were  too  voluminous  to email)  onto  the discs  to facilitate a
successful transition of the systems he managed to the team member who was taking
over his position. He maintained that he gave the discs directly to his team member and
never transferred the files to any other machine or device. (Item 3 at 1; Item 5 at 4)
Applicant  acknowledged  being  aware  of  the  proper  security  procedures  for
handling  classified  information  when  he  was  employed  by  Company  A.  However,  he
claimed that he had not had any training on handling proprietary information. He asserted
that  he  always  tried  to  follow  security  rules  and  that  anytime  he  witnessed  someone
violating security regulations,  he  would  counsel them  and  train  them.  As  of  December
2019, he had not had any security-related incidents while employed by Company B. (5 at
5; Item 7 at 4)
In  September  2017,  Applicant  signed  an  employment  agreement  in  connection
with  his  Company  A  employment  entitled  “Employee  Agreement  –  Proprietary
Information,  Inventions  and  Other  Intellectual  Property.”  Among  the  matters  to  which
Applicant agreed were that his work product while employed by Company A was the sole
and  exclusive  property  of  Company  A  unless  expressly  released  in  writing.  He  also
agreed that he was prohibited from using, for his own  or another’s benefit, not only his
own  work  product,  but  also  any  Company  A  or  third-party  proprietary  information  with
which he had been entrusted or had otherwise acquired by virtue of his employment with
Company A. (Item 9)
SOR ¶¶  3.c and  3.d
In  his  August  2019  SCA,  Applicant  reported  that  he  had  been  “warned,
reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined” in July 2019 by Company A because he “used
a  USB  to  transfer  data/files  from  [his]  unclassified  work  computer.”  He  explained:  “My
intentions  were  to  bring  any  personal  forms  containing  my  [personally  identifiable
information (PII)], databases or tools I created (via excel, viso [sic], word, powerpoint) to
build  a  portfolio  [sic]  I  can  reference  prior  work  that  assisted/streamlined  tasks  for  my
position.” He asserted that the files that he transferred  were “from an  OPEN area” and
“from [his] personal UNCLASSIFIED computer.” While he acknowledged that he was told
by a Company A investigator that the files he transferred were “[Company A] Proprietary,”
he  claimed  that  the  files  he  transferred  “were  not  marked  with  any  type  of  Proprietary
Markings (header/footer etc).” (Item 4 at 16)
Applicant answered  “Yes”  on his SCA when asked whether  he  had  “introduced,
removed,  or  used  hardware,  software,  or  media  in  connection  with  any  information
technology  system  without  authorization,  when  specifically  prohibited  by  rules,
procedures, or regulations” within the  prior seven  years. He reported  July  2019  as the
date of the incident. For reasons not explained in the record, Applicant did not report on
his SCA that he was previously granted a security clearance. (Item 4 at 35-36, 39-40)
Applicant  was  interviewed  twice  about  the facts  and  circumstances  surrounding
his Company A file transfer activity. The first interview was conducted by a Company A
investigator  during  its  July  2019  investigation  (Interview  1).  The  second  interview  was
conducted  by  a  DOD  investigator  in  December  2019  in  connection  with  Applicant’s
security clearance background investigation (Interview 2). (Items 5, 7)
Company  A  concluded  that,  during  Interview  1,  Applicant  provided  false
statements,  including  his  self-described  “unfamiliarity”  with  Company  A  and  National
Industrial  Security  Program  Operating  Manual  (NISPOM)  polices.  When  initially
questioned during Interview 1, Applicant stated that he had not used any USB drive. After
the question was rephrased, he stated that he was uncertain as to previous usage of a
USB  drive.  After being reminded that  Company A  conducts user monitoring,  Applicant
reported that he discovered a USB drive on his desk. When asked to describe the data
saved  on  the  USB  drive,  Applicant  claimed  that  only  PII  information  containing  social
security  number (SSN)  data  was  stored  on  the  USB  drive.  After  he  was  informed  that
Company A’s system  indicated  over 2,000  documents were downloaded  onto  the  USB
drive, Applicant admitted that he copied personal files and databases that he created with
the intention to use them for reference purposes in the future. He later clarified that the
files on the USB drive were intended to be used as references for future work outside of
Company  A.  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  taken  the  USB  drive  to  his  home,  but
maintained that he never connected it to his personal computer. (Item 7)
During  Interview  1,  Applicant  signed  a  voluntary  statement  admitting  that  he
“copied  data  from  [his]  unclassified  [Company  A]  computer,  with  the  intension  [sic]  of
using files for reference purposes at a later date.” He explained:
The  files were going  to  be  a  means of  “referenced  worked” from  a  coworker
whom  [sic] trained  me  when  I initially  started.  The  files came  from  my  [two
U.S.  government   programs  on   which  Applicant  worked]  systems,  large
networks with  many  hours devoted  to  each  program. The  [USB  drive]  that
was used  to  transfer the  data  has left  [Company  A] property/grounds, and  I
stored  it at home. While  it was there, the  [USB  drive]  was not used.  I was
unaware of  the  [Company  A] Proprietary  Policy.  My  understanding  was that
it was unclassified, did  not contain classified  information  so  being  able to
reference prior work was not an issue.  . . .” (Items 7, 8)
When  initially  questioned  about  his  Company  A  file  transfer  activity  during
Interview 2, Applicant addressed both his USB drive and disc-related file transfer activity.
He  denied  transferring  any  files  onto  discs  for  his  personal  use,  but  admitted  that  he
transferred files to his USB  drive for his personal use. He asserted that he transferred
only his personal files from a folder labeled with his last name from his unclassified work
computer to his USB drive around spring of 2019. He also acknowledged that he later
realized that a folder labeled with the name of one of the U.S. government programs on
which  he  worked  was  also  copied.  He  did  not  indicate  the  specific  timeframe  that
realization occurred. He claimed that he intended to use the personal files he copied to
his USB drive  as a portfolio to assist him with a job  search, and that he had not been
offered another job at the time that he transferred the files. (Item 5 at 4-5)
After initial questioning during Interview 2, Applicant was asked if there were any
records or individuals that would contradict the information he provided about his USB-
related file transfer activity. He replied that he believed that there were not. He was then
confronted with information that the files were transferred two days prior to him submitting
his  resignation.  Applicant  denied  transferring  the  files  two  days  prior  to  submitting  his
resignation and reiterated that he transferred them in the spring of 2019 before he had a
job offer. But he admitted that he may have transferred his Company B offer letter from
his work computer to his personal USB drive two days prior to submitting his resignation
letter. (Item 5 at 5)
In his SOR answer, Applicant denied falsifying any information that he provided
during Interviews 1 and 2. He stated: “To the best of my knowledge, I did not lie or attempt
to withhold that I had used a USB thumb drive” from the investigator during Interview 1.
He also claimed that the use of USB devices to transfer files was practiced almost daily
on his Company A team and that he was “a bit confused” when the investigator explained
that his file transfer activity was against Company A policy. He reaffirmed the spring of
2019 timeline he gave to the investigator during Interview 2. Additionally, he clarified that
he gave the investigator “a broad timeline” of spring of 2019 because he did not recall the
exact date. He affirmed that he is now certain that his initial file transfer activity occurred
in  “early  spring  of  2019.”  He  also  reaffirmed:  “Again  the  files  downloaded  prior  to  me
giving notice were personal . . . The files that were downloaded days prior to me giving
my notice, was again to copy any [Company B] offer related documentation.” (Item 3)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  maintained  that,  in  “early  spring  of  2019,”  he
intended only to transfer a folder containing his personal files to the USB drive, including
“blank  tools  (weekly  checklist,  to-do  list),  school/certification  study  material,  and
documents pertaining solely to [him].” He acknowledged that in “mid to late June 2019,”
he discovered that the personal folder he transferred to his USB drive also contained an
additional folder named after one of the U.S. government programs on which he worked.
He claimed that he did not intentionally transfer that additional folder as he knew that it
contained information that did not pertain to him. The record did not indicate when or if
he notified Company A of that discovery prior to confrontation. (Item 3)
SOR ¶¶  4.a  through 4.k
Applicant’s admissions and his credit reports confirm the 11 debts alleged in the
SOR  totaling $48,087, including four utility accounts totaling  $533; six federal student-
loan accounts totaling $31,894: and a $15,660 charged-off automobile loan. (Items 3, 12,
13)
Applicant paid  the  automobile-loan  account in  September 2018  (SOR ¶  4.k) and
three   of  the   four  utility  accounts   alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   4.a   through   4.d.  He   paid   the   debt
alleged  in SOR ¶  4.d  ($26)  in November 2020. The  record does not indicate  when  he  paid
the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  4.b  ($108)  and  4.c ($332).  Applicant  did not establish  that
the  debt  alleged  in  SOR ¶  4.a  ($67)  was either paid or disputed  as  claimed  in  his  SOR
answer. In  fact,  one  of the  documents he  provided   corroborated  that  allegation.  (AE  K
through  P; GE  5 at 8;  GE 13 at 2-3)
In his August 2019 SCA, Applicant reported that he owed $7,000 to University A
for unpaid tuition that was not covered by his GI Bill. He estimated that the delinquency
began in July 2017. He planned to pay the balance once he determined which collection
agency was holding the debt. During his December 2019 SI, he revealed that he received
a phone call in October 2019 advising him that he owed the U.S. Department of Education
(USDOE)  over  $40,000  (and  not  $7,000  to  University  A).  He  denied  receiving  any
delinquency or collection notices prior to that phone call, and believed any such notices
must have been sent to either a wrong or prior address. He asserted, without providing
corroborating documents, that he initiated a plan  in October 2019 to pay $5 per month
towards his USDOE debt and was current with those payments as of December 2019.
(Item 4 at 37-38; Item 5 at 3-6)
In February 2020, Applicant entered into an agreement to rehabilitate his federal
student-loan accounts with a collection agent for the USDOE, including the six accounts
alleged in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 4.e through 4.j) and one account that was not alleged. At
that time, the total amount due for all seven accounts was $45,170. He agreed to make
at least nine monthly payments of $352 beginning February 2020, and expected to have
his  accounts  fully  rehabilitated  by  November  2020.  In  his  May  2020  response  to
interrogatories, he claimed that he was current with those payments and had reduced the
balance  to  approximately  $37,000.  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  corroborating
documents to show that any payments were made or that the accounts have been fully
rehabilitated. The information reported about these accounts on his January 2021 credit
report did not establish that they have been rehabilitated or otherwise resolved. (AE J;
Item 3; Item 5 at 8)
Applicant attributed his indebtedness to the fact that his GI Bill had “run out” as he
was finishing his degree with University A and did not cover the entirety of his expenses
as he anticipated. Without indicating to what year(s) he was referring, he asserted that he
was  “unable  to  pay  any  amount”  towards  his  debts  due  to  underemployment  with  an
annual salary of $45,000, which he used to pay for his living expenses. He claimed that
he has “made a point to get [himself] out of debt and work on [his] credit” since becoming
employed by Company B, with an annual salary that increased by “more than  double.”
He reported that he successfully increased his credit score from “very poor to good.” The
record did not otherwise specify his relevant income history and expenses, or other details
about his overall financial stability. It also did not indicate whether he  had any financial
counseling  or  the  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  have  impacted  his
finances. (Item 3; Item 5 at 8)
Whole Person  Concept
Applicant’s  work  performance  and  character  are  highly  regarded  by  nine
individuals who wrote reference letters on his behalf. None of those individuals signified
that  they  were  aware  of  the  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  or  Applicant’s  USB-related  file
transfer  activity.  (AE  A  –  I).  Applicant  asserted  that  three  of  the  individuals  who  were
Company A coworkers (AE A, C, F) were aware of that activity. (Item 5 at 5) However,
the extent of that awareness was not indicated in the record. Two of those three Company
A coworkers now work with Applicant at Company B (AE A, C).
During his Air Force service, Applicant served as an Assistant Non-Commissioned
Officer in Charge (NCO) of Security Forces Training and alternate security manager (SM).
His  duties  as  SM  included  creating  security  policies  and  regulations.  He  also  was
entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the security clearance information of over
7,000  airman.  His  supervisor  stated  that  Applicant  was  “always  very  respectful  of
classified information and was a stickler of rules and regulations.” (AE D)

"The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  K  that  Applicant  committed  seven  security
infractions  between  April  2017  and  October  2019,  and  a  security  violation  for
accumulating  more  than  four  security  infractions  in  a  12-month  period  in  March  2018.
Applicant admitted the six security infractions for entering a prohibited area with his cell
phone  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  c,  and  f  –  h).  He  denied  that  he  improperly  marked  classified
documents in March 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and that he failed to store classified documents
in an approved container in March 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.e).
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  into  my
findings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant,   64,  graduated   from   high   school,  attended   college,   and   received   his
bachelor’s degree  in 1980. Since  then, he  has completed  technical certifications related
to   his   area   of   expertise   in  supply   chain  management.   He   has  worked   for  different
federal  contractors  since   1979.  He  has  been   working   for  his  current  employer  and
clearance  sponsor, a  federal contractor,  since  2007. He  married  in 2002, and  has three
adult daughters and two grandchildren. (Tr. 15)
After Applicant was granted eligibility for a clearance for the first time in 2015, he
received security training and learned that he was prohibited from bringing a cell phone
into  a  classified  area.  Since  then,  he  has  participated  in  annual  security  refresher
training,  reinforcing  the  security  rules.  His  most  recent  security  refresher  training
occurred in May 2021. (AE 2; GE 6)
Applicant  testified  that  all  of  his  cell  phone  security  infractions  were  accidental.
The  phone  security  infractions  were  caused  by  his  desire  to  be  diligent  when
responding to requests for support, meetings,  or a last-minute  tasking in  the  classified
area.  He  explained  that  he  has  two  offices,  one  within  the  “green  area”  (unclassified)
and the other inside the “red area” where all classified information is handled. He would
walk  into  the  red  area  with  his  cell  phone  in  his  pocket.  After  a  couple  of  minutes,  he
realized  his  security  infraction  and  he  would  immediately  report  the  incident  and
surrender his phone to his facility security officer (FSO). After each occasion, his phone
was  inspected  by  security  officials  to  ensure  that  no  classified  information  was
compromised. (GE 3)
After  the  first  three  infractions  in  April,  July,  and  October  2017,  Applicant
modified his behavior and started to leave his cell phone in his car. He did not have any
more  phone  infractions  until  July  and  October  2019.  Shortly  before  his  July  2019
infraction, he started to bring his cell phone to work because he needed to  coordinate
with and help his wife with her medical appointments and care of a grandchild. After his
last phone infraction in October 2019, Applicant again modified his behavior and started
to connect his phone to its charger and to leave it in the green office on top of his desk.
He has not incurred any additional phone infractions after October 2019.
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.d,  alleging  that  he  improperly  marked  classified
documents and received a security infraction in March 2018. (Two identical pages were
marked  differently,  and  a  third  page  was  unmarked.)  He  also  denied  SOR  ¶  1.e,
alleging  that  he  failed  to  properly  secure  a  classified  document  in  March  2018.
(Classified documents were found in multiple places in his cubicle.) (GE 3)
Applicant explained that he shared a cubicle with another employee. The cubicle
had  two  computer  desks  with  their  respective  overhead  bins.  The  computers  and  the
area were also used by other company employees passing through. Applicant  claimed
one  of  the  computers  and  overhead  bin  as  his  area,  kept  it  clean,  and  maintained  it
organized. He did not manage or clean the other cubicle used by a fellow employee.
In  March  2018,  a  company  internal  audit  discovered  unattended  classified
documents  and  mismarked  classified  documents  in  the  bin  adjacent  to  Applicant’s
claimed area. According to the company records, the computer and bin area where the
unattended and mismarked classified documents were found had been assigned to him.
Applicant  testified  that  neither  he  nor  his  co-worker  knew  they  had  been  assigned  a
particular computer and bin area. After  taking responsibility for the security infractions,
Applicant  assumed  control  of  his  assigned  area  and  cleaned  and  organized  it.  He
denied  mismarking  the  document  or  improperly  storing  the  classified  document  in  the
bin. (Tr. 31-35)
An   incident  report  states  that  “there  was  no   known   compromise   of   classified
information   because   the   incident   was  within   a   secure  facility,  but  open   storage   is   not
allowed”. (GE 9)  Applicant accumulated  more  than  four security  infractions within a  12-
month  period, and  according  to  company  policy, such  behavior established  a  reportable
security violation.  (SOR ¶  1.f)
Applicant  has  done  well  with  his  company.  He  testified  that  he  has  always
received  top  ratings  in  his  performance  evaluations.  (Tr.  20-21)  His  supervisor
considers him to be a valued team member, a trusted employee, and the go-to person
for  several  company  projects.  (AE  1)  He  has  established  a  strong  reputation  and  is
respected  by  peers  and  employers
trustworthiness,  and
professionalism. His supervisor intends to keep Applicant within her organization even if
he were to lose his clearance eligibility. (AE 3)
for  his  dedication,
Applicant’s  company  information  systems  security  officer  (ISSO)  submitted  a
strong  letter  endorsing  his  eligibility  for  a  clearance.  (AE  4)  He  has  interacted  with
Applicant  for  the  last  two  years.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  has  demonstrated  honesty,
trustworthiness,  and  his  ability  to  follow  rules.  He  believes  that  Applicant  displays  a
positive attitude and a strong work ethic. He believes that Applicant voluntarily disclosed
all  of  his  accidental  infractions  because  he  is  honest  and  follows  the  rules.  He
highlighted that Applicant was counseled and he changed his habits. As  of the date of
his letter in June 2021, Applicant had not had any recent infractions.
Applicant’s  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  and  industrial  security  manager  also
submitted  a  letter  endorsing  his  eligibility  for  a  clearance.  (AE  5)  The  FSO  previously
held the position of  ISSO, and  was  aware  of  Applicant’s  security  infractions.  The  FSO
noted  that  Applicant  always  self-reported  his  security  infractions  and  notified  the
security team of his mistakes. He believes Applicant understands the rules and is willing
to  hold  himself  accountable.  The  FSO  believes  Applicant  is  one  of  the  most  honest
people  he  has  ever  encountered.  He  recommends  Applicant  for  a  clearance  without
hesitation.
Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his security infractions and violation. He
believes  that  he  voluntarily  reported  his  infractions  because  of  the  training  he  has
received  since  2015,  and  the  annual  security  training  refresher  courses.  (Ge  6)  He
believes that he now has a system in place that has been working since October 2019,
to make sure that he does not have any future infractions. He promised to do his best to
avoid any future infractions. He is concerned with the security of the United States and
would never do anything to jeopardize national security.

"Applicant  is a 49-year-old  employee of  a defense contractor  (Company B).  She
has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since  April  2017.  She  seeks  to  retain  a  security
clearance,  which  she  has  held  since  about  2003.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
2006.  She  is  married  for  the  third  time  after  two  divorces.  She  has  an  adult  child.
(Transcript (Tr.) at 15-17,44; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  worked  as  a  cybersecurity  specialist  for  a  defense  contractor
(Company  A)  from  2009  until  she  was  terminated  in  March  2017  after  allegations  of
poor  performance,  timecard  fraud,  and  copying  proprietary  information  onto  a  thumb
drive.  Applicant’s  section  failed  an  inspection  in  November  2016.  Her  title  and  salary
remained the same after the inspection, but she no longer supervised employees.  She
went to human resources (HR) in November 2016 with a complaint that she was blamed
for  the  failure.  On  January  14,  2017,  she  again  reported  to  HR  what  she  viewed  as
unethical practices by the company’s leadership. (Tr. at 17, 33-34; GE 1-3)
In  about  November  or  December  2016,  Applicant  sought  employment  with
Company  B.  On  February  7,  2017,  Company  B  sent  her  a  welcome-to-the  company
email with information about her pre-employment actions to complete, including a drug
test.  Applicant’s  supervisors  at  Company  A  had  difficulty  locating  her  in  January  and
February 2017.  On  February 8,  2017, Applicant  was  given  a  verbal warning regarding
her  absences  and  her  inability  to  be  contacted  by  fellow  employees.  On  February  8,
2017,  Applicant  downloaded  about  3,000  files  from  her  Company  A  computer  and
server  onto  an  unencrypted  thumb  drive.  The  files  included  32  personal  files,  and  the
rest were Company A’s files. (Tr. at 27, 33-36, 51; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
On February 9, 2017, Applicant’s  management chain requested the company to
conduct  an  investigation  into  suspected  timecard  fraud.  On  February  14,  2017,
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the  investigators  about  her  hours  and  about  the  files  on
the thumb drive. (Tr. at 27; GE 2)
Applicant testified that she gave her employer two weeks’ notice on February 14,
2017, before the investigation was initiated. There  is nothing  in Company A’s report of
the  investigation to  substantiate that  assertion.  Company A  was  aware  from  reviewing
Applicant’s computer that Company B had requested that she undergo a drug test. She
was asked if she had a job offer from Company B. She stated that she accepted the job
offer,  but  a  start  date  was  yet  to  be  determined  until  all  contingencies  were  met.
Applicant was placed on paid suspension until the investigation was complete. She was
terminated  by  Company  A  on  March  17,  2017.  Applicant  asserted  that  Company  A’s
actions  against  her  were  because  of  her  whistleblower  report  to  HR.  (Tr.  at  22-23;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  stated  that  she  was  not  terminated  from  Company  A  because  she
voluntarily resigned to take the job  with Company B before she was terminated. I note
that  she  reported  on  her  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
November  2017  that  she  was  “Fired,”  and  her  attorney  noted  in  her  response  to  a
proposed   debarment   that   Applicant   was  “terminated”  in   retaliation   after  she   reported
unethical  conduct  to   HR   and   she   gave   notice  of  her  intent   to   resign.  Applicant  was
successful  in the  debarment  action.  (Tr.  at  22-23, 40-44; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;
GE  1)  For the  purpose  of  this decision, it makes little difference  whether Applicant was
terminated   or  resigned   before  she   could  be   terminated.  The   underlying   conduct  is  the
issue here.
Applicant  denied  the  allegation  of  timecard  fraud.  Company  A  investigators
checked  Applicant’s  timecards  against  the  records  of  when  she  swiped  into  her  work
facility,  and  determined  that  over  a  six-month  period,  there  was  a  discrepancy  of  294
hours. Applicant asserted, and her supervisor confirmed, that her supervisor permitted
Applicant  to  unofficially  work  from  home.  Additionally,  the  investigators  checked
Applicant’s primary facility, but the company had another facility a few miles away. The
records would not show all the time she spent at that facility and traveling back and forth
between  the  facilities.  Finally,  Applicant’s  supervisor  suspected  that  Applicant  was  not
working all of the hours that she reported on her timecards, but with the approval of the
supervisor  above  her,  they  chose  not  to  question  Applicant  about  her  hours,  and  just
approved Applicant’s timecards. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
During  her  interview  by  Company  A  investigators  on  February  14,  2017,
Applicant admitted that she downloaded the files. She stated that she was backing up
her personal files, and found it easier to copy her entire directory and go to a meeting
while the files were being copied. She stated that she planned to delete the Company A
files from the thumb drive, but had not had the opportunity to do so. (Tr. at 27; GE 2)
The investigation determined that it took 68 minutes to download the more than
3,000 files onto the thumb drive. It would have taken less than two minutes to download
Applicant’s personal files. The investigation concluded that Applicant is an experienced
cybersecurity  professional  who  knew  it  was  inappropriate  to  use  an  unapproved  and
unencrypted thumb drive to download Company A proprietary information. (GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  she  “inadvertently”  and  “purely  by  accident”  transferred
the  Company  A  proprietary  files  along  with  her  personal  files  to  the  thumb  drive,  and
that  it  was  never  her  intention  to  download  or  keep  the  files.  She  stated  that  it  was  a
simple swipe to download everything, and that she did not notice that it took more than
an hour to download the files because she went to a meeting. Applicant’s assertion that
she “inadvertently” downloaded the files is inconsistent with her statement to Company
A  investigators  in  February  2017  that  she  found  it  easier  to  copy  her  entire  directory.
She indicated that she knew that plugging in  the thumb drive would prompt a report to
the security office; she self-reported the incident to the security office; and she returned
the  thumb  drive  the  same  day  that  the  files  were  downloaded.  That  assertion  is
inconsistent with the report of the investigation that showed the files were downloaded
on  February  8,  2017,  and  Applicant  provided  the  thumb  drive  on  February  14,  2017,
when she was interviewed. She  later testified that she went to security on February 8,
2017, who told her that copying her own personal files was not against their rules and
procedures. (Tr. at 27-30, 37-40, 44-45, 51-54; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted   a   Questionnaire   for   National   Security   Positions  (SF  86)  in
November  2017.  She   reported   the   timecard   issues  with   Company   A,  but  she   did  not
report  that   she   downloaded   Company   A’s   proprietary   files   without  the   company’s
authorization.  Even   if  the   downloading   was  inadvertent,  she   should   have   reported   the
information  under the  Use of  Information  Technology  Systems question  that asked: “In
the  last seven (7) years  have  you  introduced, removed, or used hardware, software, or
media   in  connection   with   any   information   technology   system   without  authorization,
when   specifically   prohibited   by   rules,  procedures,  guidelines,  or  regulations   or
attempted  any of the  above?”1  (GE 1)
During  her  March  2019  interview  for  her  background  investigation,  Applicant
discussed  the  timecard  allegations.  She  also  indicated  that  she  downloaded  personal
files onto a thumb drive. There is no indication in the report of the interview that she also
downloaded  Company  A’s  files.  In  her  response  to  the  SOR  allegation  that  she
downloaded about 3,000 Company A files onto a thumb drive, she wrote:
I partially  admit. While  working  at [Company  A] for approximately  8  years
I  worked   on   numerous  computer  systems;  one   work  station   which  could
be   considered   my   personal  work  computer  which  housed   unclassified
information  and  numerous other work stations which did contain  classified
information.   After  I  accepted   my   new   job   at  [Company   B]  I  transferred
what I had  accumulated  on  my  “personal work computer”  to  a  thumbdrive.
Things  included   were  tax   returns,   leases,   receipts   and   various  other
personal  items;  I  admit  I  should  not  have   had   these   items   on   my
computer.  Nonetheless  when   leaving   [Company   A]  I  transferred   all   my
files. I would note  that nothing on my computer was classified at all. I knew
this when I took this action.
I  was  contacted   shortly   after  that  [Company   A’s  system]  put   out  a
notification   of   this  transfer.   Once   notified   I  immediately   returned   the
thumbdrive   with   all   files.  I   did   not  download   any   file   to   any   computer
including all of  my personal documents.
I did not find Applicant credible. After considering all  of  the evidence,  I find that
she  intentionally  downloaded  Company  A  proprietary  information,  and  she  has  been
less than forthcoming about her conduct up to and during her hearing.
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  her  character  and
excellent job performance, both at Company A and Company B. She is praised for her
work ethic, patience, mentoring skills, positive attitude, technical proficiency, leadership,
stability,  discretion,  dependability,  professionalism,  trustworthiness,  and  reliability.

1   Any  matter  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be
considered  in  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  when
conducting the whole-person analysis.
",False
"Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a defense contractor, employed since 2018.
He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1989 to 2002, and on active duty in the U.S.
Army from 2002 to 2015, when he retired. He received an honorable discharge and retired
at the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 3. He also served in a foreign country military from
1969 to 1987, before he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He reported attending college
at  two  universities,  but  not  receiving  a  degree.  He  married  in  1982  and  has  two  adult
children. He does not currently hold a security clearance.
The SOR alleges under Guideline K that in June 2015, while serving on active duty
in  the  U.S.  Army,  Applicant  received  a  general  officer  memorandum  of  reprimand
(GOMR) for improperly transporting and storing classified information and for possessing
six  government  computers  at  his  residence,  both  in  violation  of  the  Uniform  Code  of
Military Justice (UCMJ); and that his local access was suspended in about October 2014.
(SOR ¶ 1.a) The SOR also alleges that Applicant was unable to account for a classified
government external hard drive, and that when he was requested to return the hard drive,
he substituted a different drive that contained another agency marking and the remnants
of  a  “secret” sticker. Applicant  was unable to  explain  how he  gained  possession  of the
agency hard drive. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Under  Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  falsified  his  2018  SCA  by
disclosing his reprimand and claiming that it was for “slack observation of security policy,”
when  in  fact  it  was  a  reprimand  for  negligence  and  failure  to  maintain  the  standards
expected of a U.S. Army Officer and [agency] technician after over 4,000 documents and
imagery files classified as SECRET, TOP SECRET/SCI, or otherwise classified/protected
were found on government computers and other media stored in his private residence,
as described in SOR ¶ 1.a. (SOR ¶ 2.a) The SOR also alleges Applicant falsified his 2018
SCA by deliberately failing to disclose that his security eligibility/access authorization was
suspended in about October 2014. (SOR ¶ 2.b)
Finally,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  concealed  and  misrepresented  material
facts  during  the  course  of  his  personal  subject  interview,  conducted  by  a  government
security investigator in October 2018 and February 2019, by stating that the reprimand
for “slack observation of security policy” listed in his SCA, concerned taking a personal
cell  phone  into  a  sensitive  compartmented  information  facility  (SCIF)  where  he  was
working, and  that “there  were no  adverse finding from the searches” of his property. In
truth, the SOR  contends  that  Applicant  received  a  GOMR after over 4,000 documents
imagery
files  classified  as  SECRET,  TOP  SECRET/SCI,  or  otherwise
and
classified/protected,  and  six  government  computers,  were  discovered  in  his  personal
residence as described in SOR ¶ 1.a. The investigation into these matters was terminated
in December 2015 after Applicant refused to cooperate with U.S. Army Intelligence (USAI)
investigators. (SOR ¶ 2.c) Applicant answered the SOR by “admitting” certain facts with
explanations;  however,  he  did  not  admit  the  SOR  allegations  as  presented.  (Ans.)
Therefore, I will consider Applicant’s answer as a general denial of the SOR allegations
but with explanatory testimonial evidence.
In June 2013, Applicant’s unit conducted an “AR 15-6” investigation into allegations
of  potential  security  violations  against  Applicant.  The  investigation  concluded  that
Applicant  committed  security  violations  under  Army  regulations.  Applicant  worked  in  a
SCIF and had access to classified documents and data. In November 2012, a systems
and  hardware  inventory  was  conducted  in  the  SCIF  where  Applicant  worked,  and
discovered  that  an  external hard  drive  that “may  have  once  been  under the  control”  of
Applicant was not accounted for. Applicant had been seen plugging a similar hard drive
into  his  classified  (SIPR)  computer  days  prior  to  the  inspection.  A  coworker  also  saw
Applicant  use  a  hard  drive  marked  “unclassified”  that  he  retrieved  from  his  personal
backpack and insert it into a classified computer. Applicant’s coworkers  suspected that
the hard drive  was  the same drive  missing from the SCIF, as  they often  saw the hard
drive plugged into Applicant’s computer during the day, but sometimes missing at night.
(Item 6)
In  November 2012,  a  100%  entry and  exit  inspection  was  conducted  inside  the
SCIF. When Applicant approached the inspection area and observed workers emptying
out their pockets for inspection, Applicant dropped his backpack off at the inspection site
and  abruptly  headed  back  toward  his  work  area.  When  he  returned  to  retrieve  his
backpack, it was searched, and a stack of loose CDs were found. Some were marked
SECRET/NOFORN. Applicant explained that he was taking the CDs to another office, but
he was instructed that classified CDs could not be transported inside a personal backpack
and that he needed a proper container for such purposes. After permitting Applicant to
take the CDs to the office, it was later discovered that he never left them at the office as
he claimed.
An inspection of  the SCIF also found Applicant’s cell  phone  in his  desk drawer,
which  is  prohibited  inside  a  SCIF.  Upon  questioning,  Applicant  admitted  to  having  an
unauthorized  cell  phone  in  the  SCIF,  improperly  transporting  classified  media  in  his
personal belongings, uploading an unclassified hard drive into a classified system, and
uploading an improperly labeled CD in a classified system.
Applicant  denied   having   any   knowledge   of   the   missing   hard  drive,  but  claimed
another hard drive with a classified sticker that he was using in the SCIF was “scrubbed”
and  he  took it home. He  was asked  to  retrieve  the  hard drive  from  his home.  He returned
with   a   hard  drive   with   the   classified   sticker  scratched   off   but  with   another  sticker  in  it
showing  it was from  a  government agency. The  investigator determined  that this was not
the same hard drive that was missing  from the SCIF.  (Item 6)
Applicant consented to a search of his home. In his garage, investigators found six
Government  desktop  computers  and  monitors,  and  13  black  cases  containing  agency
CDs.  Applicant  had  arranged  for  the  computer  equipment  to  be  shipped  to  another
location, but his possession of the equipment at his residence was not authorized. Some
of  the  equipment  contained  files  marked  as  limited  distribution,  including  NATO
Unclassified, NATO Restricted, and NATO SECRET. Applicant’s personal media devices
contained a large number of highly classified documents with markings as high as TOP
SECRET/NOFORN. In all, Applicant possessed over 4,000 documents and imagery files
classified up to TOP SECRET/SCI and 86 archived files which contained material marked
SECRET  on  government  and  personal  computers  and  media  storage  devices  at  his
residence. Applicant admitted bringing a personal, unauthorized cell phone into the SCIF,
improper  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  and  protected  information,  personally
declassifying  media  devices  without  proper  authority,  and  intentionally  taking  and
transporting classified media to his personal residence.
Although investigators did not find evidence that Applicant transferred information
to  an  unauthorized  individual  or  entity,  foreign  or  otherwise,  he  did  connect  his
government computers to the internet at various times and he had a Skype contact list
with 17 entries for users in foreign countries. Over 20 USB and external storage devices
had been connected to Applicant’s laptop at some time, many of which were not included
in the original seizure. Applicant generally denied to Army investigators any wrongdoing
or  intentional  possession  of  classified  information.  He  voluntarily  permitted  initial
inspection,  but  denied  permission  for  an  enhanced  inspection  of  his  devices  by  a
specialized  cyber  counterintelligence  office.  Investigators  obtained  a  command  search
authorization instead. (Items 6 and 7) According to Applicant’s JPAS incident history, his
local  access  was  suspended  during  the  investigation  on  or  about  October  2014,  and
remained suspended. Applicant’s  commander recommended his security clearance be
revoked on or about October 2015. (Item 5)
On  June  19,  2015,  Applicant  received  a  General  Officer  Memorandum  of
Reprimand (GOMR) from his commanding general. He was reprimanded for improperly
transporting and storing classified information, possessing six government computers at
his residence, in violation of the UCMJ. He was reprimanded for his negligence and for
failure to maintain the standards expect of him as an Army officer and technician holding
a TS/SCI clearance. (Item 8) He acknowledged receipt of the reprimand on July 14, 2015
without submitting any rebuttal matters within the time period allotted. The GOMR was
filed in his official Army personnel record. (Item 8)
Applicant  completed his SCA on August 3, 2018. In section 13A  –  Employment
Activities, he listed his active duty employment history. In response to a question about
whether  he  received  any  discipline  or  warnings,  he  noted  that  he  received  an  “official
reprimand” in July 2015, and listed the reason as “slack observation of security policy.” In
his answers to questions on his 2018  SCA, section 25 –  Investigations and Clearance
Record  –  Denied  Clearance,  asking  whether  he  ever  had  a  “security  clearance
eligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked,” he stated “no,” and failed
to disclose his suspended access authorization.
Applicant was interviewed by a government security investigator on October 17,
2018  and  February  25,  2019.  He  certified  the  resulting  personal  subject  interview
summary as accurate on August 23, 2019. He discussed his official reprimand for “slack
observation of security policy” and claimed the issue occurred when he left his personal
cell  phone  in  the  SCIF  where  he  worked.  He  was  aware  of  the  security  violation  and
acknowledged that he made a mistake and was forgetful. He stated that his technology
devices  were  inspected  as  a  result,  but  there  were  “no  adverse  findings  from  the
searches.” (Item 4) He noted that he was given a verbal and written reprimand for slack
observation of security policy, issued by an unrecalled “major.” He stated that he was not
disciplined or suspended for the incident, and that he has not misused any information
technology system, to include failing to complying with rules, procedures, guidelines or
regulations  that  may  raise  a  security  concern  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or
willingness to protect such systems. (Item 4)
In Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR on  February 4, 2021, he  noted  in response to
the Guideline K SOR allegation ¶ 1.a, that he was issued a GOMR rather than judicial
action  because  “mitigating  circumstances  prevailed.”  He  claimed  that  the  government
computers found at his home were legitimately transferred from an agency school to Army
units.  He  claimed  that  the  computers  were  at  his  residence  because  they  were  wiped
clean and he needed to connect to the internet for updates. In response to SOR ¶ 1.b, he
claimed  that  the  classified  hard  drive  missing  from  the  SCIF  was  used  by  all  soldiers
assigned to the unit, but he accepted responsibility as the ranking officer. He stated that
he  allowed  inspection  of  all  hard  drives  in  his  possession  to  “verify  my  personal
innocence.”
In  his  response  to  Guideline  E,  SOR  allegation  ¶  2.a,  Applicant  stated  that  he
admitted to the government security investigator that he was reprimanded, and referred
the  investigator  to  his  official  records  as  he  felt  constrained  to  discuss  it  in  a  “public
setting.” In response to SOR ¶ 2.b, he stated that he transferred out of a classified setting
in November 2012 and worked until he retired in December 2015 and that “all I was aware
of was that I was read-off and did not need to know.” In response to SOR ¶ 1.c (regarding
his statement during his summary interview), he noted that he was “referring to an incident
with a cell phone not to the circumstances that caused a General Officer reprimand. That
investigation was concluded with the reprimand and I officially retired from the U.S. Army
in December 2015.” (Ans.)
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in  Chief,  the President has the  authority to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of  Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of  the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history of  the applicant  that  may disqualify the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than  a  scintilla but less  than  a  preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein  and  an  applicant’s security  suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the  ultimate burden  of  demonstrating  that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue  his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700  at 3  (App. Bd. Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity  clearance  determinations should  err, if
they must, on the side  of denials.” Egan, 484  U.S. at 531; see,  AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline K: Handling Protected Information
",False
"Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  married  man  with  two  adult  children.  He  has  a  college
degree in the field of computer science, a master’s degree in management, and a master’s
degree  of  business  administration.  (Tr.  20)  Applicant  has  been  working  in  the  defense
contracting industry for nearly 40 years. For much of that time, he has worked in advanced
logistics  and  hardware  engineering.  (Tr.  25)  Applicant  joined  his  current  company  in  2017,
after  having  worked  for  his  previous  employer  since  1984.  (Tr.  20)  He  has  held  a  security
clearance for his entire career. (Tr. 14, 31)
In  April  2017,  approximately  four  months  before  Applicant  began  his  current  job, he
downloaded 9,000 files from the company drive of his then-employer to a personal hard drive
and  a  personal  removable  media  drive.  (Answer  at  1;  43)  Some  of  the  downloaded  files
contained  sensitive  and  proprietary
templates,  proprietary
coursework, and competition-sensitive operational data and cost volume information about a
proposal that his company was working on. (Tr. 26, 49; 2 at 6; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 10, 17)
Company  policy  prohibited  downloading  of  proprietary  information  onto  personally  owned
devices. (GE 4 at 3)
information,
including
Applicant  contends  that  he  had  no  intention to steal any proprietary information, and
that  he  was  unaware  that  any  of  the  information  that  he  transferred  to  his  personal  media
devices was proprietary. (Tr. 11, 37) Rather, his intent was to back up his “samples” folder of
all  of  the  different  methods  that  he  used  over  the  years  to  perform  his  job.  Applicant’s
“samples”  folder  contained  a  collection  of  all  of  the  lessons  that  he  learned  during  his
career,  in  addition  to  various  code  that  he  had  written  over  the  years.  (Tr.  12,  21-22)
Applicant considered it his personal intellectual property. (Tr. 66) Moreover, he contends that
it  was  common  practice  to  store  company information on personal thumb drives before  the
policy was changed in 2014. (Tr. 34) When Applicant first began backing up what he thought
to be non-proprietary information, a pop-up information technology warning banner appeared
on  his  computer  screen,  informing  him  that  he  should  not  connect  a  personal  device  to  a
company  asset.  (Tr.  43;  Answer  at  3;  GE  2  at  5;  Tr.  35)  Nevertheless,  he proceeded with
the information transfer. (Answer at 3)
The  most  files  that  Applicant  ever downloaded in his career with his employer before
the download in April 2017, was five. (GE 4 at 2) The size of Applicant’s download and the
amount  of  time  that  it  engaged  his  work  computer  to  complete  it  prompted  a  company
investigation in May 2017. (GE 6 at 1) The investigation was spearheaded by the director of
capture management and the lead investigator of the division where Applicant worked.
Applicant’s company issues its employees external hard drives for data backups. (GE 6
at  27;  Tr.  40)  When  the  investigator  asked  Applicant  during  his  interview  why  he  used  a
personal  device  for  his  information  device  rather  than  the  device  that  his  company  issued,
Applicant  explained  that  he  needed  a  second  backup  in  the  event  that  he  lost  the  primary
backup while traveling or working from home. (GE 6 at 27) This explanation made no sense to
either the director of capture management or the investigator. (GE 6 at 27) At the conclusion
of the investigation in August 2017, the capture management manager was still reviewing the
contents of the downloaded files and continuing to discover sensitive proprietary information.
(GE 4 at 3
By the time the investigation was completed, Applicant had retired, left the company, and
begun  working  for  his  current  employer.  (GE  1  at  11)  The  investigator  had  retrieved  the
external drive from Applicant and wiped it shortly after initiating the investigation. (Tr. 58) The
job Applicant took after retiring from his previous employer was director-level, a position  that
paid  substantially  more  money  than  his  previous  position.  (GE  2  at  7) Applicant informed
his current supervisor of the episode.  (Tr. 28)
Applicant  characterizes  his  conduct  as  a  good-faith  mistake  in  judgment  when  he
assumed  that  all  of  the  information  was  his  personal  intellectual  property  rather  than  his
employer’s  intellectual  property.  Moreover,  he  contends  that  he  had  no  intention  of
damaging  his  company  financially  by  sharing  its  intellectual  property  with  competitors
because “that’s where [his] pension is coming from.” (Tr. 29)
Applicant  is  highly  respected  on  the  job  and  in  his  community.  He  is  active  in  his
church,  and  spends  hours  working  with  youth  in  the  community,  coaching  basketball  and
leading  a  Cub  Scout  troop.  (AE  C,  D)  According  to  a  current  coworker,  his  compliance with
regulations  is  exceptional.  (AE  A)  Another  coworker  characterized  him  as  “a  person  of
extreme  integrity.”  (AE  E)  A  coworker  from  his  previous  job  characterized  him  as  “honest,
conscientious,  dedicated,  and  helpful.”  (AE  B)  According  to  Applicant’s  wife,  he  is  an
extremely meticulous individual who organizes playbooks for the youth teams he coaches and
annotates the repair manuals for their home appliances. (AE D)

"Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and SOR ¶¶ 4.a – 4.g,
all without further comment. He denied the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.h, 4.i, and 4.j,
all with narrative explanations. He did not answer SOR ¶ 2.b, but it is a cross-allegation
of subparagraphs ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, both of which he admitted. Applicant’s admissions and
explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Tr. 52)
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996. He has taken subsequent graduate classes and
is about four credits shy of a master’s degree. (Tr. 53, 63; GE 3 at 11-12)
Applicant’s  employment  history   is  detailed   in  security   clearance   applications
(SCAs)  he   submitted   in  connection   with   his  employment,  in   January   2010   (GE   1),
February  2015  (GE  2),  and  January  2018  (GE  3)  and  an  SF-85P  application  for  a
position  of  public  trust  in  September  2018.  (GE  5)  Applicant  also  submitted  a
Declaration for Federal Employment (DFE) in September 2018. (GE 4)
From 2007 until July 2012, Applicant worked in various classified positions with a
variety  of  defense  contractors.  (GE  1  at  17-22,  46,  GE  2  at  15)  He  has  held  various
positions  in  the  IT  field,  mostly  as  a  contractor,  in  the  years  since.  Since  July  2017,
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  defense
contractor  S.  (GE  5  at  10)  He  has  held  a  clearance  for  about  15  years,  and  he  also
holds a clearance with another government agency (AGA). (Tr. 13, 53-54, 141-142) At
the time of the hearing, he had an annual salary of $120,000. (Tr. 143)
From   July   2012   to   July   2013,  Applicant  worked   for  another  department  of  the
U.S.  Government  as   an   information   security   specialist.  He  testified   that   he   had
nationwide   responsibility   for  IT  security   regarding   the   Affordable   Care   Act   (ACA),
working   with  each  of  the  50  states.   He described  the  experience  as “a nightmare.” He
had  no  prior government experience,  and  little  to  no  support. He said he   had  “no  idea
what to  do.”  He missed  deadlines and  acknowledged  that  he  “failed  to  perform  up  to  the
expectations”   of  the   job.  He   said   it   was  “completely   my   fault.”  (Tr.  55-57)   Following   a
written   warning   in  January   2013,  Applicant  was  terminated   from   that  position   in  July
2013  for unsatisfactory  performance.  (SOR ¶¶  4.f,  4.g)  (GE 2  at 13-14) As Department
Counsel  acknowledged,  the   “internet  rollout”   of   the   ACA  had   significant  problems,  as
was  widely   publicized   at  the   time, and  Applicant  was  by   no   means  solely   responsible.
(Tr.  98-99)  Applicant  said  he   did  not   have   any   personality   conflicts,   and   praised   the
interpersonal and  professional skills of his co-workers there. (Tr. 99-100)
Shortly   thereafter,  in   July   2013,   Applicant  began   working   for  government
contractor   C.  He   said  he   loved   his   job,   which  involved   travelling   to   Army   bases
nationwide   and   testing   IT   equipment.   He  also  said   the   job   was  in  a   very   stressful
environment  with   lots  of   travel  and   little  sleep.  He  said  he   did  not  get  along   with   his
boss. Following  two  written  warnings, in September 2013  and  December 2013  (SOR ¶¶
4.f, 4.e), Applicant was placed  on  a  probationary  performance  plan. In  about April 2014,
he  and  his boss got into  a  heated  argument.  Applicant was  terminated  soon  thereafter
for failing  to  perform  to  expectations and  for losing  his temper. (SOR ¶  4.c) (GE  2  at 12-
13,  GE   7;  Tr.  58-59,  101-102)  He  did  not  dispute   his  employer’s  version   of   his  work
performance. (Tr. 60)  He believes they were looking to get him  to resign. (Tr. 101-102)
In   June   2014,  Applicant  began   working   part   time  for another federal  contractor,
T.  (GE   2   at  11;  Tr.  60-62,  107-110)  Beginning   in  December  2015,  he   also   began
working   full   time   for  another  contractor,  M.   (Tr.  61-62)  He   worked   both   jobs  until  July
2017, when  he  was terminated  by  contractor T for unsatisfactory  performance,  after he
missed   some   important  deadlines  for  the   customer  (another  large   defense   contractor)
because   he   did  not  have   enough   time   to   devote   to   the   work.   (SOR  ¶   4.a)  (Tr.  61-62,
110-112)  However, Applicant was otherwise well-regarded  by  contractor T.  (Tr. 110-112
and  AE  E, a July 2017  letter from the  president of contractor T)
Guideline K:
In May 2017, Applicant was working for contractor M at an Army facility. He said
he  was  not  in  a  “SCIF”  (Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility)  but  did  have
access to what he  called  a  “simulated” SIPRNet, which he asserted had not been fully
accredited. (Tr. 108-109; Answer) While there, he received an unclassified e-mail from
Ms. M, his government supervisor, the contractor office’s representative (COR). (Tr. 44)
The e-mail listed all of the names of the systems within the lab that were supported by
his  then  employer.  Some  of  the  systems  processed  classified  information.  The  e-mail
was  labeled  as  “unclassified,”  but  the  spreadsheet  document  contained  the  names  of
some  classified  systems.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant  was  supposed  to  complete  appropriate
“patches” for that particular week on the document and then return it to Ms. M, per her
instructions, which he did. (Tr. 36, 46; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  testimony  that  he  should  have  encrypted  the  list
when he returned it, but he said the list was also not encrypted when he got it. “I didn’t
think it needed to be encrypted because of the publically available information and there
was  no  classified  information  in  the  e-mail.”  (Tr.  47)  He  said  that  he  believes  that  the
COR  should  have  known  that  “she  was  setting  someone  up  for  aggregation”  of
classified information. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  also  denied  that any classified  spillage  took  place, because  “nowhere
within  the  SEC  community  classification  guide  does  it  say  that  the  names  of  any
classified  systems  were  themselves  classified.” (Tr.  42)  This assertion  is unsupported.
He  said  it  was  the  aggregation  of  certain  information  that  was  classified.  (Tr.  43)  He
denied moving any classified information onto an unclassified system. (Tr. 44; Answer)
Applicant  said  he   was  he   was  “accused   of   committing   aggregated   spillage.”  He
indicated   in   his  testimony   and   in   his  Answer  that   he   was  pressured   to   sign   a   security
form   acknowledging   culpability   for  the   spill.  (Answer)   He  believes  he   was  “intimidated
into  telling  the  government that it was my  fault and  [that]  I’ll  never do  it again.” (Tr. 37,
48) The security form referenced  by Applicant is not in evidence.
The  Government’s  evidence  includes  a  May  10,  2017  memo  from  the  Army
command to Applicant’s employer that names Applicant as “the originator of a classified
spillage  that  occurred  on  5  May  2017.”  (GE  8  at  3;  GE  8  at  6)  In  its  memo,  the  Army
Information  Assurance,
cited  Army  Regulation  25-2,
Paragraph  4-14,  Personnel  Security  Standards;  subparagraph  b.(6):  “New,  credible,
derogatory information revokes any standing waiver and results in immediate denial of
access to IT systems.” (GE 6 at 3)
Information  Management,
As  a  result,  Applicant’s  access  to  the  government  customer’s  information
technology (IT) system was suspended that day, pending the results of an Army inquiry.
(GE 8 at 3) As a result, Applicant could not perform his duties for contractor M, so he
was terminated, on May 12, 2017. (GE 8 at 6, Tr. 49-52) (SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.b)
The  termination  memo  to  Applicant from  his employer began, “This  letter serves
as  your  official  notice   that  you   have   been   removed   from   contract  due   to   unintentional
classified   spillage.”  (GE  8   at  4)   (Emphasis  added)  This  conclusion   comports  with
Applicant’s testimony  that his actions were unintentional and  not  deliberate. (Tr. 50-51,
103-104) He  continues  to  believe  that  the  information  at  issue  in  the  incident  was not in
fact classified; and  he  attested  that others working  in the  lab  told  him  this as well. (Tr.
106-107)  However,  Applicant   stated   at  the   hearing   that   he   acknowledged   to   his
employer at the time that he was culpable  for the incident. (Tr. 105-106)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  verbally  informed  of  the  government  customer’s
concerns about the spillage incident, but was not given an opportunity to respond, either
verbally or in writing. (Tr. 103-104) He said he  “strongly disagreed  with  the  decision  to
terminate  him,  and  he  said  he  “did  not  spill  or  aggregate  classified  information.”  He
believes  that  the  government  supervisor  should  have  “retracted”  (i.e.,  redacted)  or
encrypted  the  information.  (Tr.  37-39)  He  said  he  was  not  aware  of  the  result  of  any
government investigation into the incident, and he is not aware that his clearance itself
was  ever  suspended.  (Tr.  54-55,  139)  Nor  is  there  documentation  of  any  such
investigation in the record.
Applicant said he had no other employment issues at contractor M before he was
terminated over the spillage incident. (Tr. 107) He said he was told he was eligible for
rehire.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  also  noted  his  stellar  security  record,  with  no  violations,  and
said this would not happen again. (Tr. 39-40)
The Government did not offer testimony of any expert witness in the security field
regarding whether the spillage  was in fact classified; whether it was due  to  Applicant’s
culpability;  whether  Applicant’s  actions  were  deliberate,  negligent,  or  inadvertent;  and
what  damage  to national security  resulted from the spill,  if  any.  Beyond  the  May 2017
letter from the Army on the matter  (GE 8), the Government offered no evidence of the
conclusions of any investigating authorities. Nor did the Government offer any testimony
about applicability of any of the NISPOM paragraphs cited in the SOR.
Guidelines J & G:
In  August  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence of alcohol. (DUI) (SOR ¶ 1.b) He explained that he was drinking at a pub one
evening and was pulled over on his way home after making a left turn at a red light. He
failed a roadside breathalyzer test. He was cited or ticketed, and allowed to take a cab
home. He said he was not arrested. He went to court in August 2007 and received one
year of probation  including a six-month alcohol awareness group therapy program. He
completed  the  program  early,  in  April  2008.  (Tr.  64-65;  GE  1  at  45,  93-96)  Applicant
was required to abstain from alcohol while on probation, but resumed drinking casually
once his probation ended. (Tr. 94-95)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  was  out  one  night  at  a  nightclub  and  restaurant  with  a
friend. Applicant had about three beers and two shots. While driving the friend home in
the early morning hours, he crossed the center line and was pulled over by police. After
failing  a  roadside  sobriety  test  and  refusing  a  breathalyzer,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) (SOR ¶ 1.a (Tr. 118-119) He was
later allowed to call a cab. Applicant acknowledged at his hearing that he had had too
much to drink, and that it was “completely my fault.” (Tr. 66) He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to  two  years of  probation.  He also  spent three  weekends  in  jail.  (Tr. 65-66,
69)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  evaluated  and  found  appropriate  for  a  26-week
outpatient substance abuse treatment program. No diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder
was  indicated.  (Tr.  67-68,  72;  AE  B)  The  program  consisted  of  group  sessions.
Applicant was an active and positive participant and was regarded as a model client. He
completed the program successfully in early March 2018. (AE B)
In  November 2017, while  on probation for the  DWI, Applicant was  arrested and
charged  with  a  probation  violation,  after  he  attempted  to  purchase  a  firearm  in  a
neighboring state. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant testified that during this period, when he was
“going  in  and  out  of  jail”  on  weekends,  he  would  make  himself  feel  better  by  “buying
things.” He saw a shotgun that he thought his father would like as a gift. The best deal
for the gun was in a neighboring state, where there was no sales tax, so he went there
to purchase the weapon. (Tr.  73-74) The attempted firearms purchase was disallowed
because of the background check. (Tr. 143-144) Applicant does not own any firearms.
(Tr. 74)
Applicant testified that he was not aware that his actions were prohibited while on
probation, because he did not read the full details of his probation document and other
available information detailing the restrictions. (Tr. 73, 124) His DWI charge came up in
the  background  check  for  the  firearms  purchase.  A  warrant  was  issued,  and  he  was
arrested. Applicant had to perform 10 hours of community service as a result, which he
completed in May 2018. (Tr. 68, 71; AE C, AE D) Applicant acknowledged the probation
violation was his fault. (Tr. 73) He testified that he reported the violation to his employer.
(Tr. 124)
Applicant  testified  that  there  was  no  other  negative  impact  on  his  probation  for
the DWI. He completed  probation  successfully in  August 2019. (GE  6 at 3;  Tr. 69) He
has had no other charges. (Tr. 143)
Applicant said he was required to abstain from drinking while on probation  for two
years, and  did  so. (Tr.  119-120)  He  said  that  since  his second  alcohol offense,  he  has
significantly   curtailed   his  drinking.  He  recalled   having   “a  drink  or  two”  at  home   on
Memorial  Day   and   on   the   July   4th   weekend   (2021),  but  otherwise,  “I  really   don’t  drink
much  at all.” And  he  does not  drink and  drive  “no  matter how  much  I’ve  been  drinking.”
(Tr. 71, 119, 123)  He said he  now  consumes alcohol once  a  week or less (“if  that.”). He
said he  consumes  at most,  three  beers, and  not  to  intoxication. (Tr. 120-122) Applicant
said he  was not currently  in any  alcohol counseling  or therapy  and  does not believe  he
has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 122-123)
Guideline E:
Having  submitted  an  SCA  in  January  2018  (GE  3),  Applicant  had  a  related
background interview on September 13, 2018. (GE 6 at 5-10) Days later, on September
17,  2018  (addendum  signed  September  18,  2018),  Applicant  submitted  a  Declaration
for  Federal  Employment  (GE  4),  for  a  job  application  with  another  government
department.  (Tr.  88-89)  He  then  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  Public  Trust  Positions
(SF-85P).  on  September  27,  2018.  (GE  5) The  record  does  not  contain  a  subsequent
background interview after GE 4 and GE 5.
The Guideline E allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s allegedly deliberate
failure to disclose some of his arrests and some of his employment terminations on his
January  2018  SCA  and  his  September  2018  SF-85P  application.  Applicant  denied  all
allegations of deliberate falsification in the SOR. (Answer; Tr. 74)
Alleged  Falsifications relating to  Arrests:
SOR ¶ 4.h alleges in part, that in answering a series of questions on his January
2018  SCA  with  a  seven-year  timeframe  (“In  the  past  seven  (7)  years  …”),  Applicant
failed to disclose his first DUI in 2007. (GE 3 at 35) During questioning at his hearing, it
became  clear  that  Applicant  had  no  duty  to  disclose  that  offense  in  answer  to  those
questions, since it occurred in 2007, 11 years prior. (Tr. 75-82)
Applicant  acknowledged,  however,  that  he  also  did  not  list  his  2007  DUI  in
answer to other questions on GE 3, such  as “Other than those offenses already listed,
have you  EVER had the following happen to you? . . . Have  you EVER been charged
with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or drugs?” (GE  1  at 37)  Falsification  of  that  question
was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  had   disclosed   his  2007   DUI  on   his  2010   SCA,   and   detailed   the
circumstances of  the  arrest,  his court case, and  alcohol awareness program. (GE 1  at
43-45; Tr. 96-98) He did not list the 2007 DUI on his 2015 SCA, in answer to a question,
“Have  you  EVER been  charged  with  an offense  involving  alcohol or drugs.” (GE 2  at 31-
32) When  asked  why  he  did  not  list the  2007  DUI in answer to  that question,  Applicant
said  he   “must  have   misinterpreted   the   question   and   that  it   was  another  seven-year
question.”   He  asserted   that   he   would   not   have   “intentionally   tried   to   hide   something   I
already  [had] previously  disclosed.” (Tr. 115, 116)  This omission  was not alleged  in the
SOR as a deliberate  falsification.
Applicant  also  explained  that  when  he  was  interviewed  in  2015  about  his
previous SCA, he was told by the interviewing agent that he did not have to discuss his
2007 DUI after that interview. (Tr. 75-78, 117-118) Applicant also volunteered the 2007
DUI  in  his  September  2018  background  interview  (GE  6  at  10)  and  listed  it  on  his
September 2018 SF-85P. (GE 5 at 27)
On  his January  2018  SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his 2017  DUI, but did  not disclose
his November 2017  probation  violation  arrest  for the  attempted  gun  purchase. (GE  3  at
35) This omission is alleged as an  additional deliberate  falsification in SOR ¶ 1.h.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  should  have  disclosed  his  2017  probation
violation  arrest  on  GE  3.  He  asserted  that  he  told  his  security  chief  and  program
manager about it, but this is uncorroborated. He denied intentionally failing to disclose it
and said he must have overlooked it or misinterpreted the question. (Tr. 82) However,
Applicant  acknowledged  that  in  January  2018,  the  charge  from  the  November  2017
probation violation was pending, and had yet to be adjudicated. (Tr. 144-147) As such,
he  should  have  disclosed  it  in  answer  to  the  question,  “Are  you  currently  on  trial  or
awaiting  a  trial  on  criminal  charges.”  (GE  3  at  35)  That  omission,  however,  was  not
alleged in the SOR as a deliberate falsification. The summary of Applicant’s September
2018  background  interview  reflects  that  he  voluntarily  disclosed  the  arrest  and  the
violation to the interviewer. (GE 6 at 9)
When   he   prepared   his  September  27,  2018   SF-85-P,  Applicant  disclosed   both
the   2007   DUI  arrest  and   the   2017   DWI   arrest,   but,   again,   not  the   subsequent  2017
probation   violation   arrest,  in  answer  to   a   question   about  his  criminal  history   with   a
seven-year timeframe.  (SOR ¶  4.j)  Of this  omission,  Applicant  said, “I  don’t  know  why  I
would intentionally  deny  it. Maybe  because  it  hadn’t gone  to  trial yet,  I’m  not sure.” (Tr.
83)   In   fact,   the   document  regarding   Applicant’s  completion   of   the   10   hours  of  work
release   shows  a   trial  date   of   March  27,  2018,  and   that  he   completed   the   required
community  service a  month  later,  so  the  charge  was no  longer pending  by  September
2018. (AE D)
Asked why he failed to list his 2017 probation violation arrest on either GE 3 or
GE 5, Applicant said, “I don’t know why I wouldn’t have, Your Honor. I discussed it with
both  investigators.  It  must  have  been  an  oversight  on  my  part  and  I’m  sorry.”  (Tr.  90,
130-131)
Alleged Falsifications relating to  Employment  Terminations:
SOR  ¶  4.i  concerns  several  employment-related  falsification  allegations  on
Applicant’s  September  2018  SF-85P.  (GE  5)  In  answer  to  a  question  calling  for
disclosure of all employment terminations in the past seven years, Applicant disclosed
his  2017  termination  from  contractor  M  (SOR  ¶  4.b),  but  he  did  not  disclose  his  other
terminations,  from  contractor  T  in  July  2017;  from  contractor  C  in  April  2014  (SOR  ¶
4.c); or from his federal job in January 2013 (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When asked why he did not disclose these other terminations on GE 5, Applicant
testified that he had filled out a lot of SCAs and  SF-85Ps in the past, and believed he
had  disclosed  them  previously.  He  asserted  that  the  errors  he  made  on  his  various
applications  were honest mistakes, and  were  not an  attempt  to  “obfuscate  any sins or
past indiscretions whatsoever.” (Tr. 91)
On his 2015 SCA, Applicant disclosed his termination from another government
department and provided extensive details. (GE 2 at 13-15) He also disclosed his April
2014  termination  from  contractor  C  and  noted  that  he  had  been  fired  because  the
customer was not satisfied with his work, (GE 2 at 12-13)
On  his  January  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from
contractor T, and  noted  that the  customer, a  large  defense  contractor, “didn’t need  my
input  anymore.”  (GE  3  at  14-15;  Tr.  125).  He  disclosed  his  2017  termination  from
contractor M, said that he “left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of
misconduct,”  noted  the  spillage  incident,  and  said  he  had  been  removed  from  the
contract, but was subject to rehire. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. 125)
On   his  January   2018   SCA,   Applicant  also   noted   other  terminations,  from
contractor  C,   in  April  2014   and   from   the   federal  department   job,  in  July   2013,   but   he
gave  no  details. (GE 3  at 17-18) He also answered  “No” in answering  questions calling
for  disclosure  of   adverse  circumstances   (if   he   was  fired,  quit,   or  left  by   mutual
agreement following  allegations of  misconduct or  unsatisfactory  performance). (GE 3  at
27)  Applicant  explained   that,   he   was  confused   by   the   page   break   in  the   middle  of  the
page   that  he   filled   out,   and   did  not  realize   he   should  have   answered   “yes”  to   the
question,  since   he   knew   he   had   been   fired   by   contractor  C.  (Tr.  126-129)   No
employment-termination-related  falsifications of GE 3  are alleged  in the SOR.
Applicant  discussed  his  various  terminations  during  his  September  13,  2018
background  interview.  (GE  6  ay  6-7).  However,  on  his  September  27,  2018  SF-85P,
submitted  only  two  weeks  later,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  terminations  from
contractor  C  and  contractor  T,  both  of  which  had  occurred  during  the  previous  seven
years,  in  answer  to  a  question  calling  for  disclosure  of  those  events.  (GE  5  at  22).
Curiously,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from  contractor  M,  which
occurred  within  the  seven-year  timeframe  of  the  question,  but  also  two  other
terminations from many years before, in 2002 and 2005. (GE 5 at 22; Tr. 137) Applicant
again acknowledged that he should have disclosed the terminations from contractors C
and  T,  but  asserted  that  his  omissions  were  unintentional.  (Tr.  137-138)  Applicant
expressed remorse for his errors and apologized for them. (Tr. 147-148, 161-162)
Applicant  also  did  not  list  his  terminations  from  contractors  C,  M,  and  T  on  his
Declaration  for  Federal  Employment,  in  September  2018,  despite  the  presence  of  a
question calling for disclosure of all employment terminations in the last five years. (GE
4 at Question 12). As to this form, Applicant explained that he thought the question he
was only being  asked  to  disclose  terminations from  “a federal job  or a  government job
within the  last  five  years. That’s how  I looked  at the  question.” (Tr.  134-135) Applicant
maintained  his  interpretation  of  the  question  under  additional  questioning  at  hearing.
(Tr. 135-136)
Among the documents Applicant submitted after the hearing was a  DFE that he
submitted in April 2020. (AE G) On that form, he checked “Yes” to a question asking if,
during the  last  seven  years, he  had  been  convicted,  imprisoned,  been  in  prison,  been
on probation or been on parole. The question “includes felonies, firearms or explosives
violations,  misdemeanors,  and  all  other  offenses.”  (AE  G  at  Q.  9)  He  reported  an
offense as follows:
2019   [City   B,  State   X].   2.   Year
Question   9:   Misdemeanor  DUI  5/17/----
probation  completed  August 2019. No further  issues” followed  by  a  phone
number (AE G at 2) (Emphasis added).
The   year of  the   offense   given,  2019,  is   likely  an   error,   as   probation   ended   only
months   later,   in  August  2019,   and   there  was  no   discussion   at  hearing   of   a   May   2019
DUI.   I  conclude   that  he   likely   meant   to   disclose   his  2017   DUI  on   AE   G.  Yet   Applicant
also did not list his November 2017  arrest for  the  probation  violation  on  AE  G, in answer
to   this  question   with   a   seven-year  timeframe,  and   also   said  that   probation   was
completed with “no other issues.”
AE G also contained a question asking, in part,
During the last five years, have you been fired for a job for any reason, did
you  quit  after  being  told  that  you  would  be  fired,  did  you  leave  any  job
because  of  specific  problems,  or  were  you  debarred  from  Federal
employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal
agency? (AE G at Q. 12)
Applicant  answered   “Yes”  and   disclosed   his  May   2017   termination   from
contractor  M   “per  request  of   the   Government  COR  for  allegedly   mishandling   sensitive
information;  eligible   for  rehire.”  (AE   G  at  2)  He  did  not  disclose   his  termination   from
contractor  T,  in  July   2017.   Since   Applicant   submitted   AE   G  post-hearing,  he   was  not
questioned about any of these  answers.
Since  his termination  following  the  spillage  incident  in  May  2017,  Applicant  has
subsequently participated in extensive annual training required for his position. After the
hearing,  he  provided  extensive  documentation  of  his  remedial  and  other  security
training on numerous subjects related to his professional position. (Tr. 140; AE F, AE H)
Applicant’s  2020   performance   review   reflects  that  he   exceeds   expectations
across  the  board.  He performed   “extraordinary   work”   under difficult  circumstances.   He
is  a   highly   trained   and   capable   security   professional  and   greatly  contributed   to   the
mission’s success. (AE A)

Use of Information Technology/Handling Protected Information
The  concerns  identified  under  these  Guidelines  are  listed  as  four  separate
allegations and are discussed below in order as listed in the SOR.
SOR  ¶  1.a  –  Alleged  that  Applicant  created  an  unclassified  presentation  that
contained  classified  information,  accessed  the  presentation  on  two  or  more  company
computers, and when questioned by his company security office, he only informed them
of one computer.
Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  with  explanation.  In  June  2016,  Applicant
created  and  saved  “with  some  assistance  from  other  colleagues”  an  unclassified
presentation on a company unclassified shared drive. He took “great care to ensure that
the  entire  presentation  was  unclassified.”  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  17,  42-43)  Multiple
company  employees  used  Applicant’s  presentation  and  saved  it  in  an  unclassified
network  drive.  One  of those  employees thought  there was  some  classified  information
on the presentation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 17-18)
Applicant  accessed  the  presentation  on  three  different  company  computers  by
navigating to the link on the network drive and opening that link. The presentation was
stored on the network drive. (Tr. 18) When questioned by the security office, Applicant
was asked where he stored the presentation and he informed them that he stored it on
the  network  drive.  The  presentation  was  not  stored  on  more  than  one  computer.
However,  any  computer  connected  to  the  network  drive  could  access  it.  (Tr.  18-19)
Applicant  stated  that  the  presentation  did  not  contain  any  classified  information.
Applicant  knows  that to  be  true because he reviewed  the information  with  the security
office,  along  with  the  Security  Classification  Guide  for  the  program.  Applicant  and  the
security office agreed that the information in question was not classified. (Tr. 19-20)
Applicant did not actually download or save the presentation onto any computer.
Rather, he had created the presentation on his own computer and saved it only on an
unclassified shared drive. (SOR Answer) When asked by the security office whether the
presentation was on any other computers, Applicant perceived this question to relate to
only  the  downloading  and  saving  of  the  presentation  to  a  computer,  not  the  mere
accessing  of  the  presentation  on  the  shared  drive  via  a  computer.  Therefore,  he
answered in the negative, even though he had accessed the presentation on the shared
this  was  an  honest
three  computers.  Applicant  stated
drive  via  a
misunderstanding and interpreted the security office’s inquiry in the literal sense. (SOR
Answer)
total  of
Applicant  stated  that  he  never  attempted  to  conceal  the  fact  that  he  had
accessed the presentation on three separate computers. He advised the security office
that  the  presentation  was  saved  to  an  unclassified  shared  drive,  and  therefore  would
have  been  accessible  by  multiple  users  from  any  network-connected  drive.  Applicant
was  well  aware  that  the  company’s  computer  security  officials  could  easily  and
immediately determine all users and/or devices that had accessed the presentation after
it was saved to the unclassified shared drive. (SOR Answer)
The  security  office  and  Applicant  noted  that  the  questioned  material  had  been
publicly  released  and  was  readily  accessible  through  open  sources  in  the  public
domain.  Applicant  received  no  follow-up  from  the  security  office  on  this  matter.  His
computer  was  returned  to  him.  He  was  not  cited  for  a  security  infraction.  Applicant’s
presentation still remains on the company unclassified shared drive, where he originally
saved it. (SOR Answer; Tr. 53-55)
Applicant  accessed  this  presentation  on  more  than  one  company  computer
because  the  presentation  was  stored  on  a  server.  Sometimes,  he  would  not  be  at  his
normal workstation and when he found himself at different locations, he would pull the
presentation  from  the  server  and  review it.  (Tr.  22)  As  a  take  away  from  this  incident,
Applicant  has  vowed  to  read  the  Security  Classification  Guide  as  the  first  order  of
business  before  working  on  a  particular  new  program.  In  a  typical  year,  Applicant
creates “[t]housands probably” of presentations. (Tr. 20-21)
SOR ¶ 1.b – Alleged that Applicant used a colleague’s account to access a DoD
classified system after his account had lapsed.
Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  with  explanation.  On  infrequent  occasions,
Applicant  visited  the  company  lab  without  having  first  obtaining  a  current  group
password (i.e. the former group password has expired and Applicant had not yet gone
through the administrative process to obtain the new one). Applicant was unsure of the
exact  date  when  this  occurred,  and  on  cross-examination  settled  on  the  approximate
date of 2013. On these infrequent occasions, a company colleague would log in to the
group account on Applicant’s behalf. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-23, 25, 42-43)
The lab environment involved multiple cleared individuals who typically shared a
computer or  computers  in  a  secure  place. The  practice  of  one  person  logging  on  with
the current group password and others doing the same was relatively common and  an
accepted practice of his coworkers. The Director of Integration and Testing, a company
colleague of Applicant, provided the following about the group account access practices
in the lab:
I worked  with  [Applicant]  on  the [program] from  2008-2017. [Applicant]  had
the clearance  and the  need to know to view classified data associated with
the   system.  The   program   has  many   different  computer  accounts  and
systems.  Many   of   the   computer  labs  had   shared   computers.  Employees
were  responsible   for  ensuring   they   kept  the   accounts  up   to   date   and
remembering   the   latest  group   account password.  Our satellite   integration
and  test  occurred  at  an  offsite  customer facility. For people  in managerial
roles  and   travelers  to   our  site,   like   [Applicant],   that  only   used   these
systems  occasionally;  it  was  not  unusual   to   have   their   account  or
password  not   be  up   to   date.   In   these   labs   with   shared   computers,   it  was
not  unusual  for  one   person   to   login  on   a   group   account  or  their   account
and  have  another person  access or view  test data  (while  the  user  was in
the   room).  This  was  considered   acceptable   as   long   as  the   person   was
cleared,   had   need   to   know   and   was  authorized   to   view   the   data.   (SOR
Answer (Tab D))
Applicant reiterated what Director of Integration and testing stated above during
his  testimony.  (Tr.  23-24)  Applicant  understands  that  password  sharing  of  the  sort
mentioned  above  is  not  permitted  and  inappropriate,  even  in  a  group  password  and
group account environment. He pledged to obtain and use a current group password on
visits to the company lab on all future occasions. He understands clearly that he must
personally obtain a current group password, and that it is improper for a colleague to log
into a group account on his behalf. Of note, there was an identical group password for
all users of the group account. At all times in question, Applicant was eligible to obtain
the  group  password  renewals.  He  held  the  proper  clearance  to  access  the  group
account, and always had the need to know. (SOR Answer; Tr. 25-26)
SOR  ¶  1.c  –  Alleged  that  Applicant  used  classified  material  that  was  removed
without  approval,  and  saved  the  product  in  two  locations  on  an  unclassified  company
server. He did not report this incident to company security.
Applicant  denied   this  allegation   with   explanation.  He  explained   that  a   cleared
colleague   (CC)   strictly   followed   all   protocol  and   procedures  for  the   transfer  of
unclassified   data   from  a   classified   system   (high   side)  to   an   unclassified   system   (low
side). He  properly  exported  the  data  from  the  high  side  to  the  low  side, where he  saved
it. (SOR Answer; Tr.  26-27) Applicant  was unsure of the  timeframe  when  this occurred,
stating   it  was  “around   2013   maybe.  But  since   it’s  been   so   long,  I   don’t  remember  the
exact  year. It was before 2015.” (Tr. 30, 44)
After the  data  had  been  exported  to  the  low  side, Applicant included  a  portion  of
it  in  two   presentations  he   created   and   saved   on   an   unclassified   company   computer.
When   CC   reviewed   Applicant’s   presentation,  he   recommended   that  Applicant  delete   a
small portion of it. CC knew the entire presentation was unclassified, but he believed the
audience  seeing  the  presentation  might erroneously  believe  that  the  small  portion  was
classified,  and  he  did not want to  take  presentation  time  to  explain  why  the  material was
unclassified.  Applicant  deleted   the   small   portion   of   the   presentation,  per  CC’s
suggestion. (SOR Answer; Tr. 27-29)  CC states as follows:
I worked  with  [Applicant]  in  the  support  of a  program  in  which we  analyzed
performance   data   of   an   electronics  unit  in   the   2014   to   2016   time   frame
that  was  saved   on   a   classified   system.  The   performance   data   was
unclassified.   OPSEC  CONOPs  was  followed   correctly   to   remove   the
unclassified   data   from   the   system.   We   were  allowed   to   print   unclassified
plots, stamp   them   “UNCLASS” and   take  them  outside  the   classified  labs.
The  data  was unclassified  when  removed  from  the  lab. Out of  abundance
of   caution,  additional  security   guidelines  were  taken   into   account  as  we
prepared   the   plots  of  the   data   for  presentation.   The   data   was  already
unclassified,  but  this  additional  step   made   it  more  obvious  the   data   was
unclassified,  allowing   the   presentation   to   be   made   without  having   to
explain why the data was unclassified. (SOR Answer (Tab D))
As  the  above  evidence  indicates,  no  security  violation  occurred  that  required
making  a  report  to  company  security.  Applicant  stated  that  even  though  he  did  not
compromise any classified information  and did not violate any policies, there is always
more  one  can  do  when  it  comes  to  security  and  protecting  classified  information.  It  is
better  to  be  even  more  “hyper-vigilant”  and  take  every  possible  precaution  when  it
comes to protecting classified information. (Tr. 29-39)
SOR  ¶   1.d   –   Alleged   that   between   about  2009   to   at  least   2016   Applicant
accessed   a   Government  computer  system   without  authorization   once   or  twice  a   year.
He had  “viewing  privileges” only  so  he  circumvented  this  by  downloading  test data  to  a
computer he  was not authorized  to  access and  then  having  a  colleague  transfer data  to
his computer. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant  denied  this  allegation  with  explanation.  He  explained  the  situation
described in the SOR is not an altogether accurate depiction of the facts. Similar to the
situation described in SOR ¶ 1.b, above., Applicant held the proper clearance to access
the  classified  systems  in  question.  He  was  also  eligible  to  obtain  an  updated  group
password. However, he had not gone through the administrative process to obtain the
most recent group password for the group accounts involved. In this instance, Applicant
was  visiting  a  company  site  in  another  city,  and  the  person  responsible  for  providing
updated passwords  was  absent  from  the  office  on  the  day  in  question.  (SOR  Answer;
Tr. 30-31)
The testing data involved in this situation was unclassified.  Applicant needed to
perform data analysis on the relevant unclassified testing data. The unclassified testing
data  resided  on  the  “first classified  system,” but this system  did  not offer the analytical
tools  Applicant  needed  to  properly  process  the  data.  A  “second  classified  system”
offered these tools. (SOR Answer) Applicant asked his colleague to transfer the relevant
unclassified testing data from the “first classified system” (the one without the analytical
tools he needed) to the “second classified system” (the one with the analytical tools he
needed). This  transfer did  not  require  Applicant  to  access  the  “first  classified  system,”
and he did not do so. Once the unclassified testing data was transferred to the “second
classified  system,”  Applicant  performed  analysis  using  the  tools  offered  by  “second
classified system.” (SOR Answer; Tr. 31)
Applicant  was  properly  cleared  to  access  both  the  “first  classified  system”  and
the  “second  classified  system.”  However,  he  had  not  administratively  obtained  an
updated  group  password  for  either  system.  His  colleague  logged  on  to  the  “second
classified  system”  on  his  behalf,  so  that  Applicant  could  access  and  analyze  the
unclassified  testing  data  that  had  been  transferred  from  the  “first  classified  system.”
(SOR Answer; Tr. 32) The allegation that Applicant accessed a Government computer
system  without  authorization  once  or  twice  a  year  is  not  true,  because  Applicant  was
cleared and had a need to know that information. (Tr. 32)
The  “second  classified  system”  was  not  Applicant’s  computer,  as  stated  in  the
SOR. The  two  “systems” were not computers, but rather they were  group  accounts on
classified  systems  accessible  via  a  current  group  password.  (SOR  Answer)  Applicant
performed  analysis  of  the  unclassified  testing  data  on  the  “second  classified  system.”
He  did  not  remove  any  of  the  unclassified  testing  data  from  the  “second  classified
system”  when  he  did  so.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  32-34)  Applicant  has  not  had  a  similar
situation occur like this “since 2016.” (Tr. 33) Applicant learned as a take away from this
event  that  everyone  allowed  into  the  facility  would  be  required  to  know  the  group
username  and  password  as  an  additional  safeguard  to  protect  classified  information.
(Tr. 34-35)
Applicant reiterated throughout his testimony that these incidents have instilled in
him  a  heightened  sense  of  security  awareness.  (Tr.  20-22,  29,  34-35)  Applicant  has
since  taken  numerous  security  training  courses,  and  submitted  seven  certificates  of
completion for various security training courses. (Tr. 21, 35-36, 38; AE O)
The Government cross-alleged the use of information technology concern raised
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  as  an  additional  handling  protected  information  allegation
under  SOR  ¶  2.a.  The  facts  and  mitigation  discussed  under  use  of  information
technology are applicable to the handling protected information concern.
To summarize and clarify, the last time Applicant engaged in any type of “similar
incidents  was  “about  2016,”  approximately  five  years  before  his  hearing  date.  (Tr.  36)
Applicant stated that he never engaged in behavior that resulted in the compromise of
classified material.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant’s  company  never found  that he  failed  to  properly
follow  its  policies,  regulations,  procedures,  or  mishandled  classified  material.  (Tr.  36)
Nor  did  his  company  find  that  Applicant  misused  any  information  technology.  (Tr.  37)
Furthermore, Applicant’s company never determined that he lied or lacked candor when
explaining or discussing these events with them. (Tr. 37) None of these SOR allegations
led to Applicant being disciplined by his company. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  has  since  taken  a  behavior  modification  course  following  these
incidents  to  avoid  making  similar  mistakes  in  the  future.  He  learned  how  one’s
personality  can  effect  one’s  behavior.  He  realized  that  his  persona  is  very  “task
oriented” and  “goal oriented,” which resulted in him being more focused on getting the
job  done.  He  recognizes  that  he  must  remain  “more  hyper-vigilant”  when  it  comes  to
using security precautions and avoid lapses such as not taking the proper care to know
his password. (Tr. 37-38) Applicant submitted a Certificate of Completion dated April 18,
2021,  to  document  his  having  completed  a  four-hour  behavior  modification  class  and
passing a written knowledge assessment. (AE N)
Non-Alleged Conduct
Applicant  was  denied  clearances  in  2004,  2006,  2008,  and  2018.  In  2009,
Applicant was granted a clearance. His most recent SF-86 was dated February 3, 2018,
and  was  his  ten-year  renewal  application  for  that  2009  clearance.  However,  while
holding that clearance, at the request of his employer, Applicant applied for eligibility to
access sensitive compartmented information (SCI). This SCI access was on a restricted
customer  project  in  Another  Government  Agency  (AGA).  The  AGA  denied  Applicant’s
access  to  SCI,  and  on  April  2,  2018,  notified  him  by  letter  identifying  the  reasons  for
their denial. (Tr. 45-49, 52; GE 1, GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant’s  2004,  2006,  and  2008  denials  appear  to  have  been  based  primarily
on  minimizing  his  high  school  illegal  drug  use.  (Tr.  39-40)  As  noted,  the  CAF  granted
Applicant’s clearance in 2009. Presumably, his 2004, 2006, and 2008 clearance denials
were reviewed when the CAF granted his 2009 clearance.
Applicant’s 2018 access to SCI AGA denial addressed issues involving personal
conduct.  He  completed  a  January  17,  2019  statement  to  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  that  discussed  the  personal  conduct  issues  after  submitting  his
February 3, 2018 SF-86. (Tr. 45-48; GE 3, GE 4)
During  cross-examination,  Department  Counsel  queried  Applicant  regarding
those  personal  conduct  issues.  Applicant  provided  an  answer  that  mirrored  the
information  he  provided  in  his  January  17,  2019  OPM  statement,  and  Department
Counsel moved to amend the SOR adding a Guideline E (personal conduct) concern. I
denied  Department  Counsel  motion  to  amend.  See  Transcript  for  further  details  and
Analysis section below. (Tr. 49-51, 55-56)
Character Evidence
A summary of Applicant’s closing comments follows. He recognizes the value of
information  security  and  is  very  grateful  to  have  his  current  job  and  career.  He  takes
great satisfaction in having spent the last 18 years of his professional life contributing to
the  security  of  the  United  States.  He  takes  information  security  very  seriously  and
realizes  that  he  could  have  done  better. With  the  benefit  of  hindsight  and  training,  he
realizes  the importance  of adhering to security regulations  rather than relying on  good
intentions.  He  committed  to  take  whatever  additional  steps  are  required  to  avoid  any
compromise of classified material if granted a clearance. (Tr. 40-41)
Applicant  submitted  four  character  letters,  all  from  company  employees  who
have  known  him  for  lengthy  periods  of  time.  They  attested  to  his  good  character  and
trustworthiness  and  had  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  SOR  allegations.  They  support
reinstatement  of  his  clearance.  (SOR  Answer;  AE  D)  Applicant’s  most  recent
performance review form the calendar year 2019 ranks him  as a  “Top  Performer,”  and
documents  significant  contributions  to  his  company  and  the  national  defense.  (SOR
Answer;  AE  E,  AE  K)  He  submitted  11  Certificates  of  Achievement  in  recognition  of
professional accomplishments over the past several years. His numerous awards from
his  company  recognized  him  for  contributing  to  programs  advancing  national  security,
technology, and civil needs. (SOR Answer; AE F, AE J, AE L) Applicant is active in his
community,  coaching  his  children’s  sporting  events  and  volunteering  for  civic  events
sponsored by his city of residence. (AE M)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January 2,
1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG),  which  became
effective on June 8, 2017.
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
the
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially
for  a  security  clearance,
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in
conjunction  with  the  factors  listed  in  AG  ¶  2,  describing  the  adjudicative  process.  The
administrative
impartial,  and
commonsense  decision.  According to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is a  conscientious
scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The
administrative  judge  must  consider all available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.
judge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal
is  a
fair,
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national  security
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The
applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance
decision.
the  Government  predicated  upon
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship  with
trust  and  confidence.  This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be  “in  terms of the
national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).
Guideline M, Use of Information Technology
",True
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations and clarifications. His
admissions  are adopted  as findings  of  fact.  After a thorough  and careful review of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor for approximately
18 years. He holds a master’s degree. He is married and has six children, ages 15, 14,
10, 8, 6, and 4. He has held a security clearance for 17 years. (Tr. 31, 33; GE 1)
The  allegations  are  relatively  straightforward  and  the  facts  are  not  in  dispute. The
SOR   cites   seven   separate   security   lapses   under  Guideline   K   as  follows:   ( 1 )   in
March  2007,   Applicant   installed  an  unauthorized  memory  upgrade  chip  onto  his work
computer;  (2)  in  October  2012,  he   brought   a   personal  cell   phone   into   a   sensitive
compartmented  information  facility  (SCIF); (3) in November 2013,  he  removed  hand-
written  notes from  a  SCIF, that were thought  to  be  classified, but turned  out not to  be
classified; (4) In  May  2015, he failed  to  completely  lock a  security  container at the  end
of  the day; (5) in October 2015, he  failed  to re-file classified information  and  to lock the
security   container  at  the   end   of   the   day;  (6)   in  February,  he   removed   classified
information from  the  SCIF; and  (7) in August 2018, he  brought his personal cell  phone
into the SCIF.   The exact allegations are cross-alleged under Guideline E.  (SOR)
Applicant’s explanation for each incident is as follows:
1.  March  2007  incident.  Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional.
He  was  not  aware  that  only  the  systems  administrator  could  install  new  software  or
hardware  onto  his  company  computer.  Applicant  self-reported  this  violation  once  he
realized that he was not authorized  to do what he did. There was no compromise of
classified information. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 4)
2.  October 2012  incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional.
He  realized  he  brought  his  cell  phone  into  a  secure  area  after  about  40  minutes.
Applicant immediately left the area and self-reported this violation. No calls were made
or received while the phone was in the SCIF. There was no compromise of classified
information. Applicant received verbal counseling. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE
5)
3.   November  2013   incident.   Applicant  admitted  this  violation.  It  was
unintentional.  He  took  notes  on  an  index  card  while  he  was  accessing  classified
information.  He  left  work  for  the  day  without  realizing  he  had  the  index  card  in  his
pocket. Upon realizing he still possessed the card, he returned the card to his workplace
and  he  reported  the  incident  to  security.  Upon  examination  by  security,  it  was
discovered that no classified information was contained on the card itself. Applicant was
directed to use a notebook with a classified coversheet to take notes. Applicant adopted
this practice and still uses it to this day.  He then leaves the notebook secured in the
SCIF. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 5)
4.  May 2015  incident.  Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional. He
closed the lock, but it did not fully engage. While the container was not properly secured,
it  remained  in  a  secure  area  where  only  cleared  or  escorted  people  have  access.
Applicant  immediately  self-reported  this  violation.  There  was  no  compromise  of
classified information. Applicant received verbal counseling.  (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR
answer; GE 5)
5.  October 2015  incident.  Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional.
He was distracted at the end of the day by leadership issues he was addressing and
neglected  to  complete  his  checklist,  which  resulted  in  classified  material  not  being
placed in a container and the container not being properly locked. While the container
was not properly secured, it remained in a secure area where only cleared or escorted
people  have  access.  Applicant  immediately  self-reported  this  violation  the  following
morning.  There  was  no  compromise  of  classified  information.  Applicant  received
refresher training. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 5)
6.   February   2016
incident.   Applicant  admitted
It  was
unintentional. He took a printout of his personal calendar out of the SCIF. He reviewed
the printout while sitting in his car and realized it contained classified information. He
immediately returned the printout to his office and placed it in a closed area. Applicant
immediately  self-reported  this  violation.  There  was  no  compromise  of  classified
information. Applicant received verbal counseling. (Tr. 26, 41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE
5)
this  violation.
7.  August 2018  incident. Applicant admitted this violation. It was unintentional.
He  realized  he  brought  his  cell  phone  into  a  secure  area.  It  was  there  for  about  20
minutes before he realized he had it. No classified information was discussed while he
possessed  the  cell  phone.  Applicant  immediately  left  the  area  and  self-reported  this
violation. No calls were made or received while the phone was in the SCIF. There was
no compromise of classified information. Applicant was told to be more careful. (Tr. 26,
41, 44, 48; SOR answer; GE 5)
Applicant   did   not   attempt   to   deflect   or   avoid   responsibility   for  these   security
lapses.  He  accepted  full  responsibility  for his security  mistakes. Applicant  works “hands-
on” with  classified  information  approximately  24  days a  month, including  multiple  times
a   day.   By   way   of   explanation,  Applicant  described   some   events  going   on   in  his  life
during   some   of  his  earlier  security   violations.  In   2013-2014,  he   had   just   assumed   a
leadership   role   in  his  company.  One   of   his  leadership   tasks  was  to   “fix”  two   broken
teams. There were significant personnel issues with these teams that he was trying to
overcome.  Additionally,  in  his  personal  life,  he  was  going  through  a  major  home
renovation,  and  his fourth  and  fifth  children  were  born.  His  wife  was  hospitalized  for
three months before the birth of their fourth child because of a medical condition. This
was a very stressful time for Applicant. (Tr. 34, 41-43)
Applicant described the changes he has made in his work routine to ensure that
he follows all prescribed security protocols. He has not had a security violation in over
three years. The changes he implemented include: consciously slowing down at the end
of  the  day  to  ensure  he  follows  all  the  proper  closing  procedures;  following  repetitive
patterns, such as always putting his cell phone in the same place so it is easier to check
to  see  if  he still possesses  it; at the  end of  the day,  he closes his office door, thereby
preventing  outside  distractions  from  interfering  with  his  end-of-the-day  security
procedures. (Tr. 43-45)
to   retain   confidence
Applicant’s   company   continues
in   him.   Applicant’s
immediate  supervisor  (Ms. L), who  is a  company  vice president  and  who  is responsible
for several hundred employees and contractors, testified that Applicant is currently her
deputy, acting  in her place  when  she  is unavailable.  Ms. L  has  known  Applicant for six
years and  he  has been  her deputy  for two  years. She  is fully  aware of all  the  Applicant’s
security   incidents  and  the   circumstances behind   them.  Ms. L   believes  that  Applicant
has  unquestioned   integrity   as  demonstrated   by   his  self-reporting   of   every  security
incident.  She   also   described   the   changes  she   observed   in  Applicant’s  security
practices,  e.g., he  no longer takes notes when reviewing material in  SCIF or if  he  does
take  notes  he  uses a  notebook, which he  ensures is  secured  before  leaving  the  SCIF.
Ms. L  strongly  believes Applicant  is not a  security  risk and  recommends that  his security
clearance  access continue. She  also  provided  a  written  letter of  support. (Tr. 22-27, 36-
37; AE A, E)
letters  of   support
Applicant  offered   several
from   coworkers,  church
acquaintances, and his sister. The regional security manager for Applicant’s company
commented  on  Applicant’s selection  for  an  executive  growth  program  and  that  he  was
a  top  performer. He also  wrote  about  Applicant’s security  infractions, but also  noted  that
Applicant  always  accepted   responsibility   and   never  made   excuses.  None   of  the
incidents resulted  in a  compromise of  classified  information. He concluded  his letter by
stating:  “I  trust  [Applicant]   and   do   not  question   his   loyalty   to   the   United   States   of
America.”   Three   other  coworkers  also  referenced   Applicant’s   willingness  to   take
responsibility  for his security  lapses and  described  his strong  character traits of  integrity,
reliability,  and trustworthiness. (AE A, E)
Applicant’s  church   acquaintances  describe   Applicant’s  mentorship  in  youth
programs and  his willingness to  help  others.  He  is described  as  selfless and  committed
to  helping  others. His sister described  Applicant as a  man  of  integrity  who  is reliable
and  trustworthy. (AE E)
Applicant’s job  performance  appraisals from  2013  to  2020  reflect that  his ratings
were  “exceeded   commitments”  or  “significantly   exceeded   commitments.”  Between
2005 and 2020, he was also the recipient of  numerous company awards. (AE B, F, H)

"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.c.  He  denied  SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.d.  and  1.e.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  2005.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance

Guideline K - Handling Protected Information
The allegations will be discussed in chronological order:
1.a. Applicant admits that in 2007, about 15 years ago, he made a copy and sent
a  document  that  contained  secret  and/or  sensitive  information  which,  prohibits  it  from
being copied and distributed. (TR-2 at page 12 line 3 to page 13 line 20, and GX 5 at

1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  also  in  2007,  he  emailed  a  document  to  a  co-worker
that contained sensitive information. (TR-2 at page 13 line 21 to page 15 line 6, and GX

1.c. Applicant admits that in September of 2011, about 11 years ago, he failed a
weekly audit of his DoD classified computer. (TR-2 at page 15 line 7 to page 16 line 9,
and GX 5 at page 6.)
1.e.  Applicant  denies  that  in  March  of  2015,  about  seven  years  ago,  he  sent
classified  confidential  information  over  an  unclassified  network.  He  avers  that  he  sent
“raw data” that was unclassified. It was later determined that the data, taken as a whole,
was classified. (TR at page 38 line 4 to page 42 line 21, TR-2 at page 23 line 3 to page
27 line 2, and GX 6 at page 4.) Applicant subsequently received hands-on training as a
result of this incident. (AppXs A and B at page 1.)
1.d.  Applicant  denies  that  in  March  of  2016,  about  six  years  ago,  that  he  sent
classified  information over  an  unclassified  network.  He  avers  that  the  data  in  question
was sent to him. (TR at page 22 line 21 to page 37 line 21, TR-2 at page 16 line 10 to
page 23 line 2, and at page 31 line 19 to page 33 line 24.) However, he was found to be
culpable, and received subsequent training from his employer. (GXs 3~5, and AppXs A

honorably served in the Army from 1997 to 1998, and she received an early discharge
due to pregnancy. (Tr. 7, 19) After her discharge, she had a miscarriage. (Tr. 19)  She
was married the first time from 1997 to 1998, and the second time from 2007 to present.
(Tr. 7) She does not have any children. (Tr. 7)
Handling Protected Information  and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  in  about  July  2019,  Applicant  failed  to  have  a  security
professional  inspect  the  property she  was  moving  out  of  the  sensitive  compartmented
information facility (SCIF).
After the counseling in March 2019 for failing to double wrap classified or sensitive
materials, Applicant asked to be transferred out of industrial security to a laboratory and
then to a range to be a crane operator. (Tr. 27-28) She wanted to be transferred because
there was too much work and stress in industrial security. (Tr. 28) She retained her desk
in the SCIF because the job as a crane operator was potentially temporary, and she may
have needed to return to her industrial security duties. (Tr. 32)
A coworker reported Applicant’s possession of two books which security officials
believed might show a foreign influence connection to Russia. (Tr. 34)  Applicant’s desk
in the SCIF had a book about a Russian espionage case from the World War II era that
a former security manager gave her and a 1980s book about translations from Russian
to English that she received from a coworker. (Tr. 29-32; GE 4) Security officials said a
book  about  Russian  spies  and  how  to  encrypt  writing  was  found  on  Applicant’s  desk
between March 2019 and April 2019. (GE 5 at 2) Concerns about the Russian connection
caused security to lock Applicant out of the SCIF. (Id.) Security officials alleged that she
gained unauthorized access to the SCIF; she wiped her computer when she performed a
manual backup; and she removed two boxes and a five-gallon bucket containing property
from the SCIF without security inspecting the boxes or bucket. (Tr. 38; GE 5  at 2) She
was  asked  to  bring  the  items  back,  and  she  brought  one  box  and  explained  the  other
items were food storage. (Id.)
Applicant said  a  person  working  in the  SCIF told her to  clear out her desk  in the
SCIF because  she  had  moved  to  a  different  location.  (Tr.  37; GE  2  at  19) On  July  24,
2019, she  collected  most of her personal items, such  as papers and  books,  put the  items
in boxes, and  moved  them  out of  the  SCIF. (Tr. 37; GE  2  at 20) She  placed  the  items in
her car. (Tr. 46) She  said no  one  was in the  SCIF when  she  removed  her property. (Tr.
46) She  believed  security  personnel  discovered  she  removed  her items  from  the  SCIF
because  it was on  video. (Tr. 46) When  Applicant was asked  about removing  her property
from  the  SCIF,  she  admitted  it.  (Tr.  46) Eight  days after she  removed  the  property  from
the  SCIF, she  said she  returned  the  property  for security’s inspection. (Tr. 47; GE  2  at 10)
They  did not  find  any  prohibited  items  in  the  property  she  returned  for inspection.  (Tr. 47;
GE 2  at 21)
Applicant was unaware of any regulation or rule requiring security to inspect items
being removed from the SCIF; however, she admitted that two people were supposed to
check  furniture  being  removed  from  the  SCIF  and  the  items  being  removed  when
someone  retired  or  was  terminated.  (Tr.  37-38,  44;  GE  2  at  20)  She  denied  that  she
“piggy-backed” or followed another employee into the SCIF. (Tr. 37-38, 48-49) She said
she  used  her  badge  to  gain  access  to  the  SCIF.  (Tr.  38,  48-49)  Two  days  after  she
retrieved  her  items  from  the  SCIF,  she  went  back  to  the  SCIF  to  retrieve  more  of  her
personal property, and her badge would not open the door. (Tr. 49) She was not told at
that point that she did not have access to the SCIF. (Tr. 49) She attempted to back up
her desktop computer in the SCIF, and she was unable to do it. (Tr. 38) She  said she
called the help desk for assistance. (Tr. 38) She denied that she knew how to wipe her
computer.  (Tr.  40)  She  said  there  are  cameras  throughout  the  SCIF,  and  it  would  be
stupid  for  her  to  do  something  inside  the  SCIF  that  was  a  security  violation.  (Tr.  41)
Applicant believes two coworkers conspired against her and made up the allegations in
SOR ¶ 1.a. (GE 2 at 23) The file does not contain any statements from the two employees
or from security officials with personal knowledge about: when she was locked out of the
SCIF; when she was told that her access to the SCIF was terminated;  or whether she
was alone in the SCIF when her computer was wiped and the property was removed from
the SCIF.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege in about January and March 2019, Applicant failed to
follow  procedures  for  wrapping  and  mailing  classified  or  sensitive  program  material.
Applicant’s  July  18,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal  subject
interview (PSI) states in late 2018 and March 2019, she failed to double wrap packages
containing classified or sensitive program material. (Tr. 24; GE 2 at 12; GE 7) Classified
and sensitive papers are supposed to be placed inside one envelope, and that envelope
is  then  placed  inside  another  envelope.  (Tr.  42)  The  party  receiving  the  improperly
wrapped packages  promptly reported  the  rule  violation.  Applicant admitted  she mailed
both packages, and she believes she was verbally counseled about both packages on
the same date. (Tr. 24-25) She frequently sent documents through the mail, and she knew
how to package classified and sensitive materials. (Tr. 42) She acknowledged she made
a  mistake  in  her  packaging  of  the  materials.  (Tr.  25)  She  was  overworked,  and  she
suggested she was distracted and overlooked the correct packaging of the materials. (Tr.
42-43) There was no compromise of classified information. (GE 7)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in about April 2013, Applicant failed to report her handling of
materials for which she did not have access. Applicant’s July 18, 2019 OPM PSI states
she “opened a package [she] was not cleared for”; however, the contractor’s record did
not confirm this security violation. (GE 2 at 12) In her SOR response, Applicant said she
opened  a  package  that  did  not  have  any  markings,  and  she  discovered  she  was  not
cleared for the material inside the package. She sealed the package; she placed it into
the safe; and she informed her supervisor. (SOR response) The package was returned
to  the  sender.  (Id.)  She  received  a  correction  action  memo  (CAM)  for  the  incident;
however, she  believes it  was  unfair because she had  no  way of  knowing she  was  not
cleared for the material until she opened the package. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges in September 2019, Applicant presented two classified program
refresher briefings to an employee who did not have access. For classified briefings, they
read the same information to the employee, except the name of the program is different
for each program. (Tr. 43) Applicant said the incident occurred in 2013. In 2013, Applicant
was counseled either verbally or with a CAM for a security violation because she briefed
someone  on  the  wrong  program.  (Tr.  22-23;  GE  2  at  12;  GE  3;  GE  6)  There  was  no
evidence that the improper briefing occurred in September 2019.
SOR ¶  1.f  alleges in about  July  2019, Applicant was debriefed  from  all  access to
the  building  containing  the  SCIF  because  of  the  security  violations in SOR ¶¶  1.a  through
1.e. Applicant said she  was told that she  was debriefed  because  her work  in the  SCIF
was not needed  due  to  her transfer to  work at  a  range  in another location. (Tr. 34-35) In
February  2020, she  learned  she  was debriefed  at least  in part because  of the  allegations
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. (Tr. 36)
SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges the information in SOR ¶ 1 under the personal conduct
guideline. SOR ¶ 2.b cross alleges the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. SOR ¶ 2.c
alleges that Applicant received two corrective action memos from about September 2012
to about April 2013 for the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.

"After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  56-years-old.  He  has  been  married  since  1988  and  has  two  adult
children. He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering in 1988
and  1994,  respectively.  He  was  employed  in  various  positions  for  a  federal  contractor
from June 1990 to November 2019, and has been employed as a senior system engineer
for another federal contractor since November 2019. He supported the same DoD agency
for more than 20 years until June 2020. (GE 1, 3; AE C, D, F-H, K, L; Tr. 22-23, 38-39,
54-55)
Applicant has held a security clearance since 1988. He was granted access to a
classified  DoD  IT  system  in  approximately  2005.  He  was  provided  email  accounts  on
classified and unclassified DoD IT systems and issued a Government laptop computer.
He  has  received  training  on  information  security  and  the  proper  handling  of  classified
information, including periodic refresher training. His access to classified information was
suspended in June 2020 and his security clearance was suspended in November 2020.
(GE 1, 3, 4, 7; AE D; Tr. 12-23, 42, 48, 55-56, 73-74)
From  approximately  1999  to  March  2020,  Applicant  maintained  a  large,
comprehensive  electronic  spreadsheet  file  (spreadsheet)  containing  his  personal
information  including  commercial  account  access  information,  tax  and  other  financial
information, medical information, and to-do lists. The spreadsheet included approximately
20 worksheet tabs of information. From approximately 1999 to 2015, he maintained the
spreadsheet on an encrypted, personal universal serial bus (USB) drive that he accessed
and updated, at home or work, as needed. He reported that in approximately 2015, DoD
revised  its  information  security  rules  and  prohibited  the  introduction  of  personal  USB
drives  onto  DoD  IT  equipment.  From  2015  to  2019,  he  maintained  and  routinely
transmitted the spreadsheet as an encrypted, password protected file between his DoD
and personal email accounts. (GE 2; AE L; Tr. 38-43, 53-58)
From at least 2015 to March 2020, he also maintained protected DoD information
in the spreadsheet including safe access information, and personal identification numbers
(PINs) for facility access, unclassified and classified IT network access, and for his DoD
ID card. The word “Safe” was followed by a six letter passcode which could be converted
into a DoD safe’s numerical combination. (Tr. 63-64, 69-71; AE L at 1) He maintained the
protected DoD information in a single worksheet tab titled “info” along with passwords for
various  personal  accounts  and  for  his  home  safe.  (Tr.  41)  He  routinely  accessed  and
revised the spreadsheet to reflect changes in his personal and protected DoD information
including the safe’s passcode in 2017. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE L; Tr. 40-42, 53-57)
Applicant  reported  that  in  2019,  the  DoD  agency  he  supported  revised  their
information security rules to prohibit transmission or receipt of encrypted emails between
DoD and personal email accounts. He said that in compliance with that policy, he ceased
emailing updated  versions  of  the  encrypted file  from his personal email account to his
DoD email account. By March 2020, he reached a point where the copy of his personal
information was dated and he felt it necessary to have an updated spreadsheet available
for access at  work.  He  attempted  to email the  encrypted  spreadsheet file  between  his
personal and DoD email accounts a couple of times, but the files could not be processed.
He said that he then removed the encryption and attached the spreadsheet to emails that
he transmitted between his personal and DoD email accounts. (GE 4; AE L)
In April 2020, DoD security personnel notified Applicant that they were conducting
a preliminary inquiry into the suspected spillage of classified information  attributable to
his March 2020 email transmission of a file that included a safe passcode. He confirmed
the  spreadsheet contained the word “Safe” followed by a passcode for a DoD safe that
he previously had access to, and also included his DoD IT network PINs. (AE L at 2-3)
He  admitted  his  responsibility  for  including  that  information  in  the  spreadsheet.  He
reported  sending  approximately  four  written  responses  to  the  DoD  security  personnel
conducting the preliminary inquiry between April 24 and June 2, 2020, “to  explain  [his]
actions and  answer questions.” (AE  L  at 3)  He has repeatedly claimed that he  did not
recall the spreadsheet included the DoD Safe passcode when he transmitted the March
2020  emails.  He  stated  that  he  informed  DoD  security  personnel  conducting  the
preliminary
the  spreadsheet
“approximately a year ago” or “sometime in early/mid 2019” because  that “was the  last
time  [he]  had  sent  the  spreadsheet  to  his  [DoD]  computer”  and  because  it  had  been
approximately a year since he had access to that safe. (AE L at 3) He also stated that
when initially questioned about the incident he admitted that he had made such a transfer
“a  couple  of  times  in  [March]  2020.”  (GE  4  at  2)  He  said  that  he  was  focused  on  the
suspected  March  2020  spillage  in  his  responses,  and  that  he  was  attempting  to  only
answer the question asked, because he was sensitive to engineers’ reputation for being
too long-winded in their responses. (GE 4; AE L; Tr. 58-61, 74-76)

inquiry
in
Applicant has stated that prior to submitting his June 4, 2020 response, he  was
anxious that the Government’s “concern could now be about my long-term transferring of
my file. My mind was fixed, however, on the thought that I needed to answer the question
that was being asked (my March 2020 infraction) and that it was not correct to bring in a
new ‘broader’ email concern.” (AE-L at 3) He also noted that if he could have discussed
details of his compromise with someone other than  a direct security manager, it would
have been possible for him to discuss his use of the spreadsheet in the context of the
Guideline E allegations. (GE 2, 4; AE L; Tr. 35-36, 74-76)
DoD  security  personnel  determined  that  on  about  March  5,  2020,  Applicant
transmitted the spreadsheet including a passcode that identified the combination to a DoD
safe, and PIN numbers for access to his DoD sponsor’s facility, unclassified and classified
DoD IT networks, and his DoD ID card. A preliminary inquiry found that the spreadsheet
contained classified information. Further analysis by security personnel determined that
he had transmitted a version of the spreadsheet including sensitive DoD information from
his unclassified DoD email account to his personal email account approximately once a
week  (223 times) from at least 2015 to March  2020, and that over a  period of  several
years  he  appeared  to  routinely  update  sensitive  DoD  information  in  the  spreadsheet,
including the safe passcode in 2017. (GE 1, 2, 4; AE L; Tr. 49, 79-99)
In his July 2020 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he
had been warned or disciplined in April 2020, because he “sent FOUO Information (PII)
in an unclassified email environment,” and “stored and sent classified information within
an  unclassified  email  environment.”  (GE  1  at  12-13)  He  reported  that  his  security
clearance eligibility/access had been suspended in June 2020 because he “sent classified
information within an unclassified environment.” (GE 1 at 39)
Applicant stated  that in June  2020, he  learned  that the  DoD security  concerns were
his long-term  transmission  of a  spreadsheet,  and  lack of transparency  about his conduct.
He said that he  “made   full   disclosure of   [his]  actions at [his]  next opportunity, which was
during  his [security  clearance  background  interviews]”   in July  and August 2020.  (AE  L  at
3)  During  those  background  interviews  with  a  government investigator, Applicant said that
he had  transmitted  the  spreadsheet as an  encrypted  file  between  his personal and  DoD
email  accounts.  He reported  that in  March 2020, he  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  email
the  encrypted  spreadsheet file  between  his personal and  DoD email accounts  a  couple
of   times,  “but  the   files   could  not  be   processed.”    (GE  4   at  1,  2)  He   said  that  he   then
removed  the  encryption  and  transmitted  the  spreadsheet.  When  asked  why  he  had  tried
to  send  the  encrypted  file  after a  policy  prohibiting  that practice  was instituted, he  said
that policy  was neither written  nor explicit  and that when  he  had previously tried  to  send
an  encrypted  file  and  the  system  would not permit its transmission,  he had  assumed,  or
it was implied  that transmission  of encrypted documents  was prohibited  by  policy. (GE  4
at 5-6)  He said  he  had  forgotten  the  spreadsheet  included  his  classified  DoD IT network
PIN, DoD ID PIN, and safe  passcode.  He also  told a  background  investigator that he  had
added  the  DoD safe  passcode  to  the  spreadsheet  approximately  a  year earlier  and  sent
those   files  to   himself  via  email.  (GE   4   at  3)  He  said   that  he   last  accessed   classified
documents in  the  safe  in mid-2019,  while  working  for a  previous  employer. He also said
that the  safe  had  since  been  relocated  and  was no  longer used  for classified  storage.  He
acknowledged   that  he   was  not  supposed   to   store   classified   information   with   personal
information,  and  said  that he  had  been  trained  on  and  was aware of  policies  regulating
the  use  of  DoD email,  and  the protection of  sensitive and classified information. (GE 4)
Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  2.a,  and  2.b,  with
explanations; admitted, in part, and denied, in part, allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.c, and 2.c,
and denied the allegation at SOR ¶ 2.d. (SOR Response)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and 2.a  allege  that  in  about  March  2020  Applicant  improperly
sent  an  email  with  an  attachment  that  contained  sensitive  DoD  information,  including
network and facility access PINs, and a safe combination, and that an inquiry determined
that the spreadsheet sent from his DoD email to his personal email account contained
classified  information. In  response to the SOR,  he admitted  the allegations at SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, explaining that he had intended to transmit his personal information, but
had  forgotten  that  he  had  previously  included  sensitive  DoD  information  in  the
spreadsheet. He said that he had been told this information was not classified, that he
had previously included it in the file because he feared that he might forget the access
information, and that his conduct was an inadvertent, isolated event. (SOR Response)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 2.c allege that Applicant exhibited a prolonged pattern of behavior
that endangered DoD information security, and that between 2015 and 2020 he routinely
updated sensitive DoD information in the spreadsheet file he sent between his DoD and
personal email accounts including a safe passcode, and that those actions contradicted
written statements he provided to security officials. In response to the SOR he admitted,
in part, and denied, in part, those allegations explaining that:
I sent my  personal file  to  my  personal email. I  would do  this periodically  to
provide  myself  updates  regarding  my  [personal information].  Approximately
a  year prior to  the  security  incident,  I included  the  sensitive  information  in
my   personal  file   so   I   would  not  forget  it  in  case   I  needed   to   lock  up
something  classified. I  did this so  long  ago, that when  I sent the  file, I had
forgotten  the  sensitive  information  was also  included. .  .  .  The  file  contained
my  personal information, which I would occasionally  update  if  necessary.
When    making    my    written    statements,    I  stated    that  “approximately    a    year
ago,  I    included    this  information”  in    reference    to    the   sensitive   information
included in the  file update I sent in March 2020.
(SOR Response at 2, 4)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that about once a week from 2015 to March 2020, Applicant
emailed  a  spreadsheet  containing  his  own  personal  information,  including  financial,
medical,  and  commercial  account  access  codes,  from  his  work  email  account  to  his
personal  email  account.  He  admitted  the  allegation  noting  that  the  spreadsheet  was
encrypted, except for transmissions in March 2020. (SOR Response at 3-5).
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges that he was likely aware that he was mishandling sensitive data,
that he provided misleading responses to security officials investigating the matter, and
that  he  misled  officials  about  the  nature  and  extent  of  his  behavior.  He  denied  that
allegation,  stating  that  he  truthfully  answered  questions  from  security  officials.  (SOR
Response at 2, 4)
The Government submitted an Information Security Program instruction, effective
March 22, 2018, for the DoD agency that Applicant had supported. The instruction states
that Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) applies to Unclassified Information to which
access or distribution limitations may be applied including information eligible for marking
as  “For  Official  Use  Only”  (FOUO).  The  instruction  applies  to  on-site  contractors  and
prohibits transmission of that agency’s CUI to personal electronic accounts, and requires
contractor personnel complete Information Security training annually. (GE 5 at 10, 32, 54)
Applicant  testified   that  from   at  least  2015   to   March  2020,  he   transmitted   a
spreadsheet that included  a  passcode  for a  DoD safe  used  to  store  classified  information
between  his DoD and  personal email  accounts.  (Tr.  58-64)  He said the  word “Safe” was
followed  by  a  six  letter  word that  correlated  to  the  safe’s numerical combination, but  did
not specify the safe’s location   or number. (Tr. 60-64; AE l at 1-3)  He  testified that he was
notified   in  April  2020   that  the   presence   of   safe   password   in  an   email   attachment  was
being  investigated  as spillage  of  classified  information.  (Tr.  59-60) He disputed  that the
spreadsheet included  classified information, stating that he understood  from training that
a  piece  of information  without context was not by  itself classified.  (Tr. 26-29; AE  L  at 2).
He testified  that he  believed that his DoD PINs including his classified  IT  network, facility
access,  and  ID card  PINs  were sensitive, but not classified  information.  (Tr.  30-32,  35,
48-51,   64-67;  AE   L   at  2)   He   acknowledged   that  he   had   not   asked   whether   the
aforementioned  DoD information  was classified  or not.  (Tr. 48) He said that he  notified
his  company’s  security    officer  about  the   potential  March  2020   spillage,  after  he   was
informed  of the  suspected  spillage  by  a DoD security  officer  in  April 2020. (Tr. 35-36, 50-
52) He testified  that  he  did not disclose  that he  had  updated  DoD sensitive  information  in
the   spreadsheet  for  a   number  of  years  because   he   was  focused   on   the   unencrypted
March 2020  email. (Tr.  34-35) He said that he  did not understand  the  concern was about
“the   issue   over the   extended   period   of   time   since   2015,” until   June  2020  after his company
received  a  letter  explaining  why  his facility  access had  been  revoked.  (Tr. 51-52,  74-76).
He testified  that  he  had  complied  with  post-incident counselling, and  had  removed  all  DoD
sensitive information  from  the spreadsheet. (Tr. 35-36)
He testified that he kept back-up copies of the spreadsheet including the sensitive
DoD information on his home computer and in a commercial storage system. (Tr. 64). He
said that prior to March 2020, the spreadsheet file was encrypted in order to protect the
contents. He noted that it was regular practice at the agency he supported, and consistent
with his training to encrypt CUI and FOUO information transmitted via unclassified email.
(Tr. 28-29) He explained  that he had  reported  transmitting classified  information  in  his
SCA, because he was answering the questions that were asked. He testified that he had
truthfully answered all investigator and SCA questions, based upon his understanding of
those  questions  at  the  time.  (Tr.  35)  He  also  testified  that  sometime  in  2019  the  DoD
agency he  supported prohibited  the  transmission  of  encrypted emails  to  and from that
agency. (Tr. 39-40)
A DoD counter-insider threat security official testified that investigation determined
that the spreadsheet included classified and sensitive DoD information.  (Tr. 78-99) He
said that Applicant’s classified network PIN, which could be used in conjunction with a
chipped  card  to  gain  access  to  a  classified  DoD  IT  network  was  determined  to  be
classified. (Tr. 94-99) He testified that the PIN for the DoD Agency’s door (“that’s how it
was  labeled”),  his  DoD-issued  identification  card  PIN,  and  the  safe  passcode  were
sensitive DoD information. (Tr. 86, 96-99) He also testified that there was no evidence
that the classified information had been intentionally leaked or otherwise compromised.
(Tr. 83, 94)
Applicant provided documentary evidence that he has an excellent reputation, and
has established a sound record of performance for his employers and the DoD entities
they support. Information provided in this regard notes his reliability, good character, and
recognized  technical  skills.  Many  of  his personal references  are familiar  with  the  SOR
allegations  and  expressed  no  reservations  about  recommending  him  for  a  security
clearance. He also received numerous awards and was active in his community. In May
2020, Applicant was counseled on his employer’s and sponsoring DoD agency’s policies
regarding handling sensitive information. (SOR Response; AE A-L)

He has also received two master’s degree, one in computer science (2000) and a second
in  business  administration  (2007).  Both  degrees  were  awarded  by  U.S.  universities.
Applicant has worked for Defense Department contractors as an engineer since 2015. He
was  granted  national  security  eligibility  in  December  2016.  He  is  seeking  to  retain  his
security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 22-28; GE 1 at 5-7, 10-11; GE 5.)
Paragraph 1  –  Guideline K, Handling Protected Information
The Government alleges two incidents in which Applicant failed to comply with his
employer’s  rules  and  regulations  for  handling  protected  information.  Both  incidents
occurred in 2019 and involved Applicant’s use of his work computer while in Mexico. After
the first incident in January 2019, he was verbally warned by his employer (Company A)
that  his  use  of  a  company  computer  on  an  Internet  network  while  he  was  in  Mexico
violated company policy (SOR 1.a). After he again used his work computer in Mexico in
February 2019, he was terminated (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted both allegations in his
Answer.
The details regarding these two incidents developed by the record evidence are
the following:
1.a  Verbal warning. At the hearing Applicant admitted that he violated the policy of
Company A by connecting his employer’s computer to an Internet network when he was
in Mexico visiting  his wife  and  child  in January  2019. At that time  he  was living  near the
Mexican  border  and  his wife  was living  and  working  in Mexico  near the  border. His young
child  was living  with  Applicant’s wife. He  crossed  the  border “continuously” to  see  his child
and  wife. Applicant worked  from  his home  in the  United  States, but also worked  in Mexico
when  visiting  his family. His work required  that he  connect  his computer to  the  internet
when   he   was  working   in  Mexico.   Company   A   discovered   that  he   was  logging   onto   its
computer network from  a  location  in  Mexico. He used  his wife’s Wi-Fi  system  to  access
the  internet.  At first he  did not know  that his actions violated  company  policy. He testified
that   he   was  merely   trying   to   fulfill   his   family   obligations  and   do   his   job.   His  supervisor
counseled  him  that his actions violated company policy.  (Tr. at 28-37.)
1.b   Employment  termination.  The  next  month  Applicant  repeated  his  action  of
connecting  his  company  computer  to  the  internet  while  visiting  his  family  in  Mexico.
Company  A  terminated  him.  At  the  hearing  he  admitted  that  he  knowingly  violated
company policy. (Tr. at 37- 39.)
Paragraph 2  –  Guideline M,  Use of  Information Technology
In this paragraph of the SOR, the Government alleges two separate incidents  in
November  2014  involving  Applicant’s  use  of  his  work  computer  in  violation  of  another
employer’s  (Company B) policy (SOR 2.a and  2.b). In addition  the Government  cross-
alleges the two aforementioned incidents involving connecting to an Internet network in
Mexico, as set forth in paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of the SOR (SOR 2.c).
The details regarding the two incidents in 2014 are the following:
2.a   Written   counseling.  On   November  4,   2014,   Applicant   received   written
counseling   from   his  supervisor  at  Company   B   for  failing   to   communicate   with   his
supervisor  effectively   and   for   loading   software  onto   his  work  computer  in   violation   of
Company  B’s policy.  In  his  Answer, Applicant denied  the  allegation  claiming  that  he  did
not  receive   any   counseling.  At  the   hearing   he   testified   that  he   did  not  recall   being
counselled   by   his  supervisor.  He  did  recall   that  his  supervisor  asked   that  employees
provide  him  with  a  list of  all  the  software loaded  on  their  computers and  he  determined
that   Applicant’s   list  was  incomplete.   Applicant  was  advised   that  his  actions  were
unacceptable   and   against   company   policy.  Applicant   then   removed   the   disallowed
software from  his company  computer after being  “yelled” at by  his supervisor. (Tr. at 40-
44; GE 3.)
2.b   Employment  termination.   On  November  20,  2014,  Company  B  terminated
Applicant  for his  failure  to  communicate  with  company  staff  and  management  about  a
serious error Applicant made to a client’s online system.  Applicant testified that he was
using a client’s database and he “mistakenly removed some information.” He testified that
he was questioned about his mistake. He believes the mistake was due to lack of training.
He did not initially admit his mistake, but “at the end of the day” he  “actually fessed up
and said, hey, this was my mistake” after checking his work further. He admitted that he
did not self-report his mistake. It was discovered  by  Company  B’s  client and the client
reported the error to Applicant’s supervisor. Applicant was terminated at that time. (Tr. at
44-46.)
2.c Cross allegations. The SOR cross alleges the allegations set forth in paragraph
1 of the SOR under Guideline K in this subparagraph under Guideline M.
Paragraph 3  - Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The   Government   alleges  two   instances  in   which  Applicant   provided   false
information in  his 2015 e-QIP.  Both  falsifications relate to his 2014 written warning (SOR
3.a) and  employment termination   (SOR 3.b),  which  Applicant did  not disclose  in  his e-
QIP, as required. In  both  allegations, the  Government alleges that the  omissions in the  e-
QIP   were  deliberate.   The   Government   also   cross-alleges  under  Guideline   E   the
allegations  set  forth   in   SOR   subparagraphs  1.a,  1.b,   2.a,   and   2.b.   In   his  Answer  he
admitted the  falsification allegations and provided  additional comments.
The details regarding the two falsification allegations are the following:
3.a   Failure   to   disclose   November  2014   employment   termination   for  cause.   In
Section 13A of the e-QIP Applicant was required to provide the reason for his termination
from  Company  B  in  November  2014.  He  responded  by  writing,  “I  was  laid  off  due  to
company  downsizing.”  At  the  hearing  Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  response  was
false. He explained he did not “want to remember that chapter,” but he said that  he told
the investigator the truth. An investigator in or about 2016 first interviewed applicant. The
interview following his submission of the e-QIP in November 2015 is not in the record.
(Tr. at 46-47; GE 1 at 13.)
3.b  Failure to  disclose  November 2014  written  warning  from  Company  B  and  his
termination, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b. Another question in Section 13A of the e-
QIP asks for disclosure about receiving any written warnings from Employer B or being
“officially  reprimanded,  suspended,  or  disciplined  for  misconduct  in  the  workplace.”
Applicant responded “No.” At the hearing, he explained that he made a mistake and used
“bad judgment” by falsely answering this question. He also testified that he disclosed his
termination during his two background interviews. Only the most recent interview, which
took place in September 2019, appears in the record. In  the investigator’s summary of
Applicant’s  2019  interview,  the  investigator  noted  that  Applicant  discussed  his  2014
termination by Company B and commented that Applicant stated he provided information
regarding that incident in his first interview after the submission of his 2015 e-QIP. (Tr. at
47-48; GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 4.)
Paragraph 4  –  Foreign Influence
In paragraph 4 of the SOR, the Government alleges that Applicant’s wife is a citizen
and resident of Mexico and is employed by a Mexican public safety organization. In his
Answer  Applicant  denied  the  allegation  and  commented  that  his  wife  is  no  longer
employed.
The details regarding this allegation are the following:
4.a   Mexican   citizenship,   residency,  and   employment  of  Applicant’s  wife.
Applicant’s wife is a Mexican citizen and resides in Mexico. She has a U.S. tourist visa
that permits her to visit Applicant at his residence in the United States. She is no longer
employed, but she previously worked  in a small office in her city that runs a non-profit
organization dedicated to the safety of the residents of that municipality. In that position,
she received local government benefits, but was not an official government employee.
The organization received funding from both the city and private industry. She left her job
in or about May 2002 to care for her child. At that time, she was frustrated with her job
because of the corruption of the police and politicians in her city. Her organization was
not effective in making changes to the law enforcement culture in the city. She is now a
full-time mother and studies English. The new director of her former employer continues
to  seek  advice  from  Applicant’s  wife  even  though  she  is  no  longer  employed  at  that
organization. Applicant, his wife, and their child travel back and forth across the Mexican
border regularly. He estimated that he travels to Mexico about three times per week. He
does  not  do  any  work  while  he  is  in  Mexico.  Applicant  is  helping  his  wife  apply  for
permanent residency status in the United States. (Tr. at 49-60.)
Mitigation
Applicant testified that he made mistakes in the past, but that he has learned from
his mistakes. He has changed his behavior based upon what he learned. He believes that
he has done well the last three years complying with all rules and policies of his employers
and  performing  his  job  well.  Applicant  provided  three  reference  letters.  His  current
manager wrote about Applicant’s excellent job performance and value to his team. The
CEO of Applicant’s former employer (Company C) also praised Applicant’s performance
and  professionalism.  This  reference  noted  that  he  hired  Applicant  in  2019  with  full
knowledge  of Applicant’s termination from  Company A in 2019 and the reasons for his
termination.  He  affirmed  that  Applicant  has  learned  from  his  past  mistakes  and  fully
complied with all security directives and policies during his work for Company C. He also
commented that he would hire Applicant again based upon his performance. In addition
a former supervisor wrote that Applicant was trustworthy and reliable. (Tr. at 61, 70; AE
A; AE B; AE C.)
",False
"Under Guideline K, the Government alleged that in January 2019, Applicant failed
to  properly  secure  a  marked,  classified  document  in  an  approved  container  overnight
(SOR 1.a); and that in June 2018, Applicant failed to properly secure a marked, classified
document in an approved container overnight (SOR 1.b). It also alleged that in January
2017 (SOR 1.c), July 2016 (SOR 1.d), June 2016 (SOR 1.e), May 2016 (SOR 1.f), and
September  2015  (SOR  1.g),  Applicant  brough  her  personal  cellphone,  a  prohibited
device, into a secure facility at her work location. Finally, the SOR alleged that Applicant
did not follow required self-reporting procedures after the January 2017 (SOR 1.h), July
2016  (SOR 1.i), and  June 2016 (SOR 1.j)  cellphone  incidents.  Under Guideline E,  the
Government cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct, the information presented under
SOR 1.a – 1.j (SOR 2.a).
In her response, Applicant admitted, with explanations and supporting documents,
all the Guideline K and E allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by her
admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She and her husband
have been married since June 1997. She holds a bachelor’s and master’s degrees earned
in 1994 and 2002, respectively. She has worked for her employer since 1995, first as a
contracted  employee,  then  as  a  direct  hire.  In  March  2011,  her  husband  took  a  job  in
another state and Applicant left her job to move with him.  When they returned in June
2014, Applicant resumed working for her current employer. (Answer; GX 1)
From the time she started working for her employer in 1995 until 2015, the offices
and  other  facilities  in  which  Applicant  worked  were  generally  not  secured,  such  as  a
Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) or a Special Access Program Facility
(SAPF).  SAPFs  are  usually  located  within  SCIFs.  Classified  work  in  those  facilities  is
regulated by specific rules regarding access, internal storage of documents, and use of
electronic devices, such as cellphones, laptops, and tablets. Although Applicant has held
a security clearance during the entirety of her employment, it was not until September
2016 that she began working primarily with classified information and in a SCIF fulltime.
Additionally, starting in 2015, Applicant’s company experienced a rapid expansion of its
workforce  for  newly  awarded  classified  projects,  for  which  an  increased  use  of  SCIFs
became necessary. Applicant was assigned as a manager for both the substantive work
on one of those projects and for hiring and oversight of new personnel in her part of the
organization.  Before  2015,  she  was  responsible  for  15  personnel.  After  2015,  she
eventually was tasked with oversight of between 70 and 140 personnel. This resulted in
a  sharp  uptick  in  her  workload  under  often  stressful  conditions.  She  was  issued  a
company cellphone and laptop, and had to travel to other job sites on a regular basis. In
short, Applicant became a very busy person. (Answer; Tr. 23 – 25, 26 – 30, 122 – 123)
As  part  of  this  rapid  expansion,  and  in  addition  to  basic  security  procedures
required  of  all  persons  holding  clearances,  employees  were  briefed  on  security
requirements for working in secure spaces. A common subject of those briefings, held at
least annually, was the rule against bringing cellphones, both personal and work-issued,
into SCIFs. Those secure spaces were located within a larger building for which entry and
mobility were not as restrictive as for  inside the secured areas. Lockers were installed
next to the entrance of each SCIF so that employees could secure their cellphones and
other prohibited devices on the way into those spaces. Because of the ubiquitous nature
of  cellphones  in  society  and  the  workplace,  it  appears  that  violating  the  cellphone
prohibition  was  a  common  occurrence,  so  much  so  that  around  2018,  the  company
renovated  its  workplace  to  improve  the  way  cellphones  were  regulated.  After  the
renovation, rather than being able to move about with one’s phone in an unclassified area
before going into a SCIF, employees were required to relinquish unapproved devices as
soon as they entered the building. Signage reflecting the rules about cellphones and other
electronic devices  was made more prominent,  and it appears the number of  violations
decreased significantly. (Answer; Tr. 78 – 80, 125 – 126)
SOR 1.g: On September 23, 2015, not long after she was assigned as a manager,
she attended a meeting in a SCIF with the manager of a team involved in classified work
to which some of Applicant’s personnel were assigned. She had never been in that SCIF
before. She was still carrying both phones in her purse in violation of rules against taking
them  into  a  SCIF.  During  the  meeting,  one  of  her  cellphones  rang.  She  silenced  the
phone, secured them both in one of the lockers she had passed on her way into the SCIF,
and returned to the meeting. The person with whom she was meeting  saw the phones
and stated he would not report her, and even suggested a way she could avoid being
found to have violated the no cellphone rule. She stated she was not comfortable with
that approach and left the SCIF to properly secure the phones. When the meeting was
over,  she  self-reported  her  actions  to  the  company  security  office.  Applicant’s  phones
were  examined,  and  she  provided  information  about  the  incident  by  completing  a
“Supplemental Questionnaire – Prohibited Devices.” There was no apparent compromise
of sensitive information, and the company did not discipline Applicant as a result of her
conduct. The security office employee who conducted the investigation of this incident
counseled Applicant about the need to properly store her cellphones outside of secure
areas. After this incident, Applicant did not change her routine or the way she handled
her phones because going to that, or any other SCIF was not yet part of her usual routine.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 25 – 42)
SOR 1.f:  On May 2, 2016, before going to her own office,  Applicant went to an
unclassified part of the building she worked in to begin “onboarding” new employees. At
some point, she brought some of them to the security office for in-processing. The security
office was in a SCIF, so the new employees waited outside while Applicant went in to
begin that part of their check-in process. When she entered the SCIF, she had both of
her  cellphones  in  her  hand.  A  security  office  employee  pointed  out  the  phones  to
Applicant, who said “oops.” She then left the space to secure the phones in a locker at
the entrance. Having been seen with cellphones in a SCIF by a security staff member,
she  self-reported  the  violation,  and  the  matter  was  dealt  with  in  same  manner  as  her
September  2015  violation.  Again,  no  classified  information  was  compromised,  no
discipline  was  taken,  and  Applicant  was  counseled  about  the  no-cellphone  rule  by  a
security  staff  employee.  After  this  incident,  Applicant  chose  to  deactivate  the  voice
functions  on  her  company  phone  and  leave  it  in  her  car.  The  only time  she  used  that
phone  was  for monthly  travel,  so  she  had  no  use  for it  inside  her secure  workspaces.
Applicant  still  carried  her  personal  phone  to  work  to  stay  in  touch  with  her  family  as
needed,  and  she  resolved  to  be  more  vigilant  about  keeping  the  phone  out  of  SCIFs.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 42 – 48)
SOR 1.e  and 1.j:  At the beginning of her workday on an unspecified date in June
2016, Applicant walked into the SAPF where her desk was located. When she put her
purse on her desk, she noticed one of her cellphones protruding from the bag. She put
the phone in her pocket, walked out of the secure area, and stored it in a locker. No one
witnessed this incident, and she did not report it when it happened as required. She did
not report her conduct because she  was  afraid  of  the consequences  that might ensue
after a third cellphone violation. There is no indication that any sensitive information was
compromised. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 48 – 49, 51)
SOR 1.d  and 1.i:  At lunchtime on an unspecified date in July 2016, Applicant left
her secure space and retrieved her personal phone that she had stored in a locker before
entering  the  SCIF.  After  using  the  phone  to  check  messages  outside  the  SCIF,  she
returned directly to the secure area with the phone and a notebook under arm. When she
set the notebook down on her desk, she realized she still had her cellphone with her. She
left  the  SCIF  and  stored  the  cellphone  in  a  locker  as  required.  Again,  no  one  had
witnessed this incident and Applicant did not self-report this event as required. She also
did not make any changes to the way she was handling her personal cellphone. (Answer;
GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 49 – 52)
SOR 1.c  and 1.h: On January 5, 2017, Applicant left a SCIF during a break in a
meeting she was attending there. She retrieved her cellphone from the locker  in which
she had stored it before the meeting. After checking for messages, she put it in her coat
pocket at the same time a co-worker asked to talk with her back in the  SCIF for a few
minutes. He held the door open for her and she entered without first storing her cellphone
in locker. After a brief discussion, she again left the SCIF and realized she still had the
phone in her pocket. After going to the restroom, she again secured it in a locker before
reentering the SCIF to continue the meeting. No one else knew she had the phone in the
SCIF, and she did not report this event as required. Again, she feared the consequences
knowing that she had committed multiple cellphone infractions during the prior 18 months.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 52 – 54)
After  her  January  2017  cellphone  incident,  Applicant  attended  a  previously
scheduled  security  refresher training  on  January 16,  2017,  that  reinforced  the  need  to
self-report any security violations  or infractions. After that training, she felt the need to
clear her conscience about her unreported cellphone infractions in June and July 2016,
and in January 2017. She reported all three incidents on January 23, 2017. The company
security office processed each of the three events in the same manner as the September
2015 and May 2016 incidents. In assessing the failure to self-report each incident, it was
determined that, although each individual event constituted a security infraction, all five
events and her failure to report three of them rose to the level of a security violation. The
investigation  of  that  violation  included  a  detailed  statement  from  Applicant  and  a
determination by the security staff that she was culpable of a security violation. In findings
issued on January 28, 2017, security personnel also recommended that she thereafter
be subject to periodic interviews by the security staff “to ensure that she has reported all
incidents  to  the  Security  office,”  and  that  “[m]anagement  will  provide  a  summary  of
selected  corrective  action(s)  to  Security  within  two  weeks  of  receiving  this  report.”
According to Applicant,  no  one interviewed her after that report  was  issued, and there
were no corrective actions identified. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 54 – 56)
Applicant  received  a  letter  of  reprimand  after  the  January  2017  security  office
report.  The  only  subsequent  corrective  action  by  management  consisted  of  informal
counseling by security staff, which included suggesting ways Applicant could change her
daily  routine  to  make  her  more  aware  of  the  no-cellphone  rule.  Applicant  herself  took
actions such as wearing rings in a certain way to sensitize her about what might be in her
hands. She also had her cellphone calls forwarded to her office phone so she could leave
the cellphone in her car each day. In December 2016, Applicant asked for a pager that
could  be  taken  into  secure  spaces  so  her  family  could  contact  her  without  using  her
cellphone; however, Applicant did not receive the pager until after her January 5, 2017,
infraction. Available information does not show that she received any remedial security
training in response to her violation. (GX 3; Tr. 56 – 60)
SOR  1.b:  On  June  12,  2018,  Applicant  reported  to  security  that  she  had
mishandled classified documents by leaving them on her desk overnight. Even though
her  desk  was  in  a  secure  space,  that  space  was  not  approved  for  open  storage.
Therefore,  the  documents  were  required  to  be  secured  in  an  approved  safe  or  other
locking container. The documents were Powerpoint slides intended for display on June
11 in a conference room approved for open storage; however, when she got to the room
it was being used, so she returned to her desk, intending to return to the conference room
to put the slides up later. Applicant put the slides on her desk but became busy thereafter
and forgot about them. She failed to properly store the slides before leaving for the day.
She saw them when she returned to work the next morning and reported the matter to
security.  A  subsequent  investigation  determined  this  to  be  an  infraction  caused  by
negligence, and that there was no likelihood of compromise.  No disciplinary measures
resulted from this infraction. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 60 – 67)
SOR  1.a:  On  January  31,  2019,  Applicant  reported  to  security  that  she  had
mishandled classified documents by leaving them on her desk overnight. Even though
her  desk  was  in  a  secure  space,  that  space  was  not  approved  for  open  storage.
Therefore,  the  documents  were  required  to  be  secured  in  an  approved  safe  or  other
locking  container.  On  January  29,  she  met  with  a  co-worker  who  worked  in  another
building.  The  meeting  was  held  in  a  secure  conference  room  in  Applicant’s  building.
During the meeting, the co-worker handed Applicant a document marked as classified. It
was not protected from view by a manila folder as it should have been if the co-worker
brought it from another building. After the meeting, Applicant  returned to her office and
put the document on her desk. It remained there until late the following day, when  she
noticed for the first time that the document had classified markings on it. She shredded it
before  leaving  for  the  day  and  self-reported  this  incident  to  security  the  next  morning.
Applicant  asserts  that  she  did  not  immediately  realize  the  document  had  classified
markings on it,  because they were in black instead of  red as required, and as already
noted, it had not been carried to the meeting in a manila folder as required. For his part,
Applicant’s  coworker  asserted
the  document  was  properly  marked,  but
acknowledged  that  it  was  carried  improperly  (he  folded  it  in  half  inside  a  notebook)
between buildings. Applicant denies that the document was folded at all. (GX 1; GX 2;
GX 3; Tr. 68 – 71)
that
After  Applicant  self-reported  the  January  2019  incident,  the  security  office
determined that there was no risk of compromise and that the infraction was the result of
Applicant’s  negligence.  Applicant  testified  she  received  a  letter  of  reprimand  after  this
incident that also addressed her June 2018 infraction. She claims the letter, which was
not produced at hearing, and which she claims her employer has not produced despite
her  repeated  requests,  accused  her  of  “unethical”  conduct  in  connection  with  those
events.  Applicant  takes  umbrage  with  that  characterization,  which  she  felt  was  overly
harsh under the circumstances. After this incident, Applicant devised a checklist to use at
the end of every workday to ensure nothing in her area of responsibility is left unsecured.
A  previous  version  was  provided  at  the  hearing  as  an  example  of  her  efforts  to  avoid
similar misplacement of classified information in the future.  Applicant also testified that
she  has  either  reported  security  violations  of  others  or  has  brought  potential  security
violations to the offenders’ attention and encouraged them to self-report. (Answer; GX 1;
GX 2; GX 3; AX C; AX D; Tr. 74 – 78)
Applicant presented information suggesting that her employer’s security practices
were deficient. She argued that her training was insufficient because there was no special
attention paid to cellphone infractions, and that in response to her violations, there was
no remedial training provided. She did not identify what that training would entail or how
any deficient security practices by her employer caused her to commit any of her security
infractions. The investigative materials that documented security officials’  responses to
all her cellphone infractions show that she was verbally counseled about the rule against
cellphones  each  time,  and  she  stated  multiple  times  that  she  understood  the  rules.
(Answer; GX 3; AX C; Tr. 88 – 94)
In  a  footnote  in  Applicant’s  response  to  the  SOR  (Answer  at  page  5,  fn1),  she
recounted  another  instance  in  which  she  brought  a  prohibited  device  –  her  company
cellphone – into a secure space. This conduct was not alleged in the SOR, but was further
developed through  her hearing testimony, both on direct and cross-examination.  (I am
only  examining  it  as  part  of  my  assessment  of  information  probative  of  mitigation.)  As
previously  discussed,  after  her  May  2016  cellphone  infraction,  Applicant  decided  to
deactivate most of the voice functions in her company cellphone and leave it in her car.
She then kept the device in a bag she used when she traveled and in which she would
also carry her laptop and other business-related travel needs. In January 2017, after she
received a pager, she had company technicians completely deactivate the phone. The
company then instructed her to send the device to a corporate facility for disposal. In the
late summer or early fall of 2019, Applicant and her team were working on a weekend,
and she decided to treat her team members to bagels and coffee in the SCIF. To carry
the food and drink, as well as the usual items she brought to the office every day, she
retrieved the travel bag from her car. Believing it to be empty, she filled it with the items
she needed to carry, then entered the SCIF. When she emptied the bag of its contents in
the SCIF, she found the deactivated cellphone. She had forgotten to send the device to
the corporate facility as she had been instructed to do. The device itself was not charged
and appeared to be unusable even if charged. Not long thereafter, she sent the device
for  disposal.  Applicant  never  reported  this  incident  to  the  company  security  staff.  She
averred that she did not report this matter because it would serve no purpose to report
that  she  had  brought  a  useless  device  into  a  SCIF.  She  also  was  wary  of  the
consequences of reporting her actions after she had been cited for “unethical” conduct in
her second letter of reprimand a few months earlier. While that letter was not produced
for this record, the testimony of her former supervisor confirmed the nature of the letter
and he response to it. Additionally, Applicant disclosed her receipt of the second letter of
reprimand  in  her  most  recent  e-QIP  and  it  was  discussed  during  her  July  15,  2019,
personal subject interview (PSI). (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 82 – 88, 110 – 111)
Applicant has accrued an exemplary record of performance during her tenure at
her  company.  She  also  enjoys  a  solid  reputation  in  the  workplace  and  has  been
recognized  for  her  own  professional  accomplishments  and  as  a  mentor  to  young
engineers.  In  the  community,  she  and  her  husband  are  personally  vested  in  specific
charities related to their family’s experiences and interests stemming from the loss of one
of their children. Applicant’s former supervisor (he is now retired) testified that he knew
her to be an excellent employee and that he would unreservedly recommend her for a
position  of  trust  despite  his  knowledge  of  some  of  her  security  incidents.  Applicant’s
performance reviews, letters of recommendation (including from her current supervisor),
various technical qualifications and certifications also reflect positively on her character
and reliability. (AX A – C; Tr. 98 – 101, 119 – 123)

"In  Applicant’s  answer to the  amended  SOR, he admitted  the allegations in SOR ¶
2.d  and  3.a.  He denied  all  the  other allegations. His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old strategic cyber-security advisor who has been employed
by  another  government  agency  (AGA)  for  about  a  year.  (Tr.  18)  He  was  previously
employed by a defense contractor as a cyber planner from August 2017 until he was hired
by  the  AGA  on  a  date  not  reflected  in  the  record.  The  SOR  was  issued  while  he  was
employed by a defense contractor.
Applicant  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  about  35  years,  working  for  various
government  agencies  as  well  as  defense  contractors.  (Tr.  20-21)  He  first  received  a
security clearance in 1992. He received a top-secret clearance in 2009 as an employee
of a defense contractor. (AX HH)
Applicant  attended  college  on  an  Army  ROTC  scholarship,  and  he  was
commissioned as an officer in the Army National Guard in May 1989. In February 1992,
he  received  an  honorable  discharge  from  the  Army  National  Guard  to  accept  a
commission in the Army Reserve. (AX MM) He served on active duty in the Army Reserve
until  he  was  released  from  active  duty  in  January  1999  and  separated  with  a  general
discharge under honorable conditions. (AX D at 1) He served in the Army Reserve again
from July 2000 to September 2002 and received an honorable discharge. (GX 11 at 16;
AX  D at  2)  He  has a 30%  disability  for service-connected  injuries. (AX  G;  AX  NN)  He
received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  1989,  a  master’s  degree  in  June  1992,  and  a
master’s in business administration in May 2001.
At the hearing, Applicant submitted testimonials from numerous co-workers and
supervisors  in  the  cyber-security  field.  He  is  highly  regarded  for  his  technical  skills,
leadership, and understanding of foreign policy. (AX A; AX OO)
The amended SOR alleges multiple falsifications (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.e-2.i), other
personal conduct  (SOR ¶¶ 2.b-2.d) under Guideline E, and foreign  influence  concerns
under Guideline B (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.c). The evidence pertaining to the allegations in the
amended SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   2.b.   On   November   19,   1998,   while   Applicant   was   on   active   duty,   he
received   nonjudicial punishment  under Article  15,  Uniform   Code   of   Military Justice,  10
U.S.C. § 815,  on  July 19, 1998, for violation  of a  general order by being  in  an  off-limits
club, engaging  in  private  employment  at  the  off-limits club, committing  an  indecent act
with  a  female  stripper, and  ejecting  the  female  stripper from  his apartment while she  was
naked  above  the  waist.  Initially, he  was charged  with  conduct unbecoming  an  officer and
false  swearing,  but   those   offenses   were   not  reflected   in   the   record  of   nonjudicial
punishment.  His punishment  was  forfeiture  of  $1,600  pay  per month  for  two  months and
restriction to his quarters and  the  military installation  for 60 days. (GX 4)
Applicant testified that he was out-processing when the misconduct occurred, and
it  delayed  his  separation.  (Tr.  47)  He  was  discharged  with  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions on January 27, 1999. (AX D)
SOR  ¶¶   2.a,  2.f,   and 2.g.  When   Applicant   submitted   SCAs   in   November 2007,
August 2014, and  December 2018, he  answered  “No” to  a  question  asking  if he  had  ever
had  a  security  clearance   suspended  or revoked.  His clearance  was suspended  in  July
1998   while  the   conduct  alleged   in  SOR  ¶   2.b   was   being   investigated,  but  he   did  not
disclose  the  suspension  of  his clearance  in any of  the  SCAs. (GX 2  at 64;  GX  10  at 30;
GX  11  at 77) On  August 11, 1999, an  attorney acting  on  his behalf requested  that his
clearance be reinstated. His clearance was  reinstated  on May 19, 2001. (GX 7)
At the hearing, Applicant testified: “I took the question as asking about operational
suspension, and I did not remember any at the time. Because it happened between out-
processing from one unit and in-processing into another unit, I did not consider it to be an
operational  suspension,  and  I  forgot  about  it  completely  as  a  reportable  event.”  He
admitted at the hearing that he now understands that he should have disclosed it. (Tr. 25)
SOR  ¶  2.c.  On  January  25,  1999,  Applicant  opened  a  checking  account  with  a
bank on an overseas military installation and deposited a worthless check for $2,050. He
represented  on  a  signature  authorization  card  that  he  was  scheduled  to  return  from
overseas in May 2000, knowing that he was scheduled to depart on  January 26, 1999,
the day after he opened the account. He reimbursed the bank after being contacted by
law enforcement authorities. He was not prosecuted. (GX 5)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he had no recollection of this incident. (Tr.
28, 49) To support his claim of a lack of memory, he submitted evidence that in December
2021, he was evaluated by his physician for chronic stroke that was discovered during a
brain  scan.  His  physician  noted  that  about  50%  of  stroke  patients  have  memory
impairment. (AX X.) Applicant is currently taking a prescription drug to enhance memory.
(Tr. 78; AX KK; AX LL)
SOR  ¶  2.d.  In  January  2003,  Applicant  was  charged  with  obstructing  a  public
officer, disorderly conduct involving drugs or alcohol, and disturbing the peace by loud
and  unreasonable  noise.  In  March  2003,  he  entered  a  nolo  contendere  plea.  He  was
convicted, fined, required to pay restitution, and placed on probation for two years. (GX
9; Tr.28) In November 2012, he filed a petition for dismissal of the charges. His petition
was granted in January 2013. The plea and finding of guilt were set aside and vacated.
A plea of not guilty was entered and the charges were dismissed. (AX JJ; AX PP; AX QQ;
AX RR)
SOR ¶ 2.e. When Applicant submitted an SCA in November 2007, he answered
“No”  to  the  questions  asking:  “Have  you  even  been  charged  with  or  convicted  of  any
offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs”; and, “In the last 7 years, have been arrested for,
charged  with,  or  convicted  of  any  offense(s)  not  listed  in  response  to  a,  b,  c,  d,  or  e
above?” He did not disclose that he was charged with alcohol-related conduct in January
2003. He testified that his attorney incorrectly advised him that a nolo contendere plea
would result in the entire proceeding being expunged from his record. (Tr. 28) He did not
provide any documentation of his lawyer’s advice.
SOR  ¶  2.h.  In  December  2010,  a  company  that  Applicant  had  founded  and
operated filed a lawsuit in British courts against several companies doing business in Iraq,
seeking damages for violation of the oil rights of Applicant’s company. In December 2013,
a  British  court  ruled  that  the  claim  “failed  on  every  point,”  and  ordered  Applicant’s
company  to  reimburse  the  defendants  for  their  costs.  In  a  subsequent  proceeding  in
October 2014, the High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division, Commercial Court, the
Court adopted a summary of the December 2013 findings submitted by a British barrister,
including  a  finding  that  Applicant  “told  lies and  misleading  statements from  the  outset.”
(GX 12 at 13) The record does not reflect what statements were made or the context in
which they were made. At the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence that the founder and
chief executive officer of one of the defendants in the British case was a U.S. citizen who
was indicted in January 2022 in a U. S. federal court for wire fraud and money laundering.
He was subsequently convicted, pursuant to a plea agreement, of five counts of willful
failure  to file  individual income  tax  returns  on  income  of  more  than  $20  million earned
through the business that Applicant sued. (AX U; AX Y; AX II)
SOR  ¶  2.i.  In  the  December  2018  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “No”  a  question
asking, if in the last seven years, he had been fired, quit after being told he would be fired,
or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance.  He did not
disclose that he was terminated from a job in December 2015. In his SCA, he stated that
he  left  this job for a  “professional opportunity.” (GX 2 at 17) At the hearing, he testified
that he had an issue with a supervisor, was given the option of moving to another position,
declined the offer, and sought employment elsewhere. He testified that he was informed
by this employer that his declination would not be recorded as a termination. (Tr. 33-34)
The employer’s records reflect that he was involuntarily terminated. However, the same
record  reflects  that  he  was  eligible  for  rehire.  (GX  13)  Applicant’s  explanation  for  his
termination is supported by the employer’s records showing that he was eligible for rehire.
(GX 13 at 2) I conclude that his negative answer to this question was not  intentionally
false.
SOR  ¶  3.a.  Applicant  is  married  to  a  citizen  of  Canada.  His  spouse  is  a  trade
advisor  for  Canada,  employed  at  the  Canadian  Embassy  since  August  2001.  She
attended college in the United States from August 1998 to May 2001, obtained a college
degree, holds a green card, and intends to become a U.S. citizen. (AX E; Tr. 19) She and
Applicant began cohabiting in March 2013 and recently married on a date not reflected in
the record. (GX 2 at 25)
SOR  ¶   3.c.   Around   2012,   Applicant  met   an   Iraqi   diplomat  who   was  promoting
investments  in   Iraq.  In   Applicant’s  December  2018   SCA,   he   stated   that  he   met  the
diplomat at a  reception  at the  Embassy of Iraq, and  they became  social friends  and  met
for cocktails on  multiple  occasions.  He stated  that they  visited  when  the diplomat  became
a  member of the  Iraqi delegation  to  the  United  Nations in December 2013.  (GX 2  at 40)
He  testified  that they  stopped  meeting  around  2014,  met  once  in  2017, and  have  not  met
since  early 2020. He  testified  that when  he  was employed  by  an  AGA,  he  disclosed  his
previous contacts  with  the  Iraqi diplomat  to  his  facility security officer  (FSO), and  did  not
make  any further contacts after 2020, because  he  received  no  guidance  from  his FSO.
(Tr. 69-73).
Applicant’s  report  to  his  FSO,  dated  September  1,  2020,  includes  the  following
comments:
I  would  note   that  I  already  reported   this  individual  as  being   an   ongoing,
although  intermittent foreign  contact six years ago. I had  not heard from  this
individual in some  time, but we remain old friends from  his previous time  as
a junior diplomat in Washington. I had understood his wife and child were
living in Virginia. I assume they still are. I would note the directions above
state  that  a  report  should  be  made  using  this  form  if  a  foreign  person  is
“inquiring about classified or sensitive” information. By way of clarification,
this did not happen. Rather, I am filing out this form as directed by my FSO
after reporting the contact IAW company SOP.

I have  taken  administrative notice   that the  United  States and  Canada  share the
world’s  longest   international  border,   and   the   defense   arrangements  between   the   two
countries  are  more  extensive  than   any  other  countries.  They  work  to   enhance   and
accelerate  the  legitimate  flow  of  people, goods, and  services between  the two countries.
The  two  countries are indispensable allies in the  defense  of North  America. They share
deeply  integrated   economies  and   enjoy   the   largest   bilateral  trade   and   investment
relationship  in the  world.  There is no  evidence  that Canada  targets the  United States for
economic or military intelligence.
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that  Iraq  is  now  a  key  partner  for  the  United
States in the region and is considered by the United States as a voice of moderation and
democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  benefits  from  functioning  government  institutions,
including an active legislature, and plays an increasingly constructive role in the region.
The  United  States  maintains  vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,
political,  economic,  and  security  issues  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.-Iraq  Strategic
Framework Agreement (SFA). The SFA between Iraq and the United States provides the
foundation  for  the  U.S.-Iraq  bilateral  relationship.  Covering  a  wide  range  of  bilateral
issues,  including  political  relations  and  diplomacy,  defense  and  security,  trade  and
finance,  energy,  judicial  and  law  enforcement  issues,  services,  science,  culture,
education, and environment, it emphasizes the important relationship and common goals
the two countries share
U.S.  bilateral  assistance   to   Iraq   focuses  on   economic  reform,   assistance   to
vulnerable   groups,  and   democracy   and   governance.   The   U.S.   continues   to   help
strengthen  the  capacity of Iraq’s civil society organizations and  elected  representatives.
U.S. bilateral assistance  aims not only to  bolster Iraq’s democratic institutions, but also to
preserve the  strategic, political, and  economic  importance  of the  U.S.-Iraq  partnership  in
a changing Middle East region.
Sectarian  militias  and  insurgent  groups  remain  active  in  Iraq,  attacking  Iraqi
security forces and civilians and U.S. interests. Iraq remains a dangerous place due to
terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, COVID-19, and the ability of the U.S.
Embassy’s  limited  capacity  to  provide  support  to  U.S.  citizens.  The  U.S.  State
Department’s Travel Advisory is Level 4 (“do not travel”).

into the findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. He is divorced with four children ranging in ages from 12
to 5. Two of the children are from a prior relationship. Applicant retired honorably from the
Navy in 2018 after 20 years of service.  He first held a security in 1998 while on active
duty.  After  retiring,  he  attended  college  and  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  from
September 2019 until around July 2020. He was out of work for about two months. (Tr. at
24-25.) He found a new position in September 2020 that paid about $10,000 less than his
previous position.  (Tr. at 25.)  He held the position  from  September 2020 until October
2022.  (Tr.  at  25.)  He  left  his  position  for  a  higher  paying  position  with  his  sponsor  in
October 2022. His new salary is approximately $15,000 more than his previous salary.
(Tr. at 25-26.)
Applicant testified he is the subject of two separate court orders. One order is for
$2,000 for his children from a prior relationship. (Tr. at 22 and GE-5 at 7.) The other order
for  $5,040  covers  his  children  from  his  marriage  and  alimony.  (GE-7.)  He  was  not
represented by counsel at his divorce. (Tr. at 74.) His former spouse was awarded half of
his retired pay in their divorce. (Tr. 25-26.) He receives approximately $631 a month in
military  retired  pay  after  withholdings.  (Tr.  at  27.)  He  also  receives  a  $2,500  monthly
veteran disability payment. (Tr. at 27.) He has been working side jobs to add an additional
$2,000 a month to his income. He acknowledged he had about $8,600 in monthly income
and had to pay $7,000 in child support and alimony each month before expenses. (Tr. at
63.) He makes payments on his other debts when he has a little extra money. (Tr. at 53.)
SOR ¶ 1.a: past-due account  charged off in the  amount  of  $22,180.  Applicant
admitted this credit card became delinquent in 2019. The credit card was used by both
him  and  his wife. The  credit card was used  mostly for household items,  but he  admitted
he  used  it to  help another woman  out.  He gave  the  woman  $10,000, but her  check did
not clear which  resulted  in “this debt.”  (Tr. at 36.) When  he  was “hit with  this debt,” he  was
paying  $2,000  in child support. He admitted  he  hadn’t taken  any actions yet on  the debt.
(Tr. at  40  and  GE-8 at 6.) This debt is not  resolved.
SOR ¶  1.b: past-due account referred for collection for $8,521.  Applicant took
out a personal loan in 2016-2017 for $10,000, when he fell behind on his finances. He
testified he tried to pay it back. (Tr.  at 44.) He stopped making payments sometime in
2017. Since 2017 he has not taken any action. (Tr. at 47 and GE-8 at 8.) This debt is not
resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c: past-due account  charged off in the  amount  of  $4,263. Applicant
took out a personal loan in 2016–2017 after he fell behind on his rent. (Tr. at 49.) He could
not recall when he stopped making payments, because “it’s been that long.” (Tr. at 50.)
He acknowledged receiving notices but not taking any action (Tr. at 50 and GE-8 at 7.)
This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.d: past-due account  charged   off the   amount   of   $3,195.   Applicant’s
credit card became  delinquent in 2019  after he  became  “overextended  slightly.” (Tr. at
51.) He admitted he had not taken action on this debt since 2019. (Tr. at 51 and GE-8 at
8.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.e:  past-due account  charged  off the  amount  of  $906. Applicant denied
this  account,  testifying  he  had  paid  it  off  in  2019.  He  did  not  have  documentation  to
support his testimony, but Department Counsel noted the account was not on the most
recent credit report, GX8. (Tr. at 52.) I have resolved this debt in Applicant’s favor because
the absence of this debt from his recent credit report, corroborated in part by Applicant’s
testimony that he paid it. This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.f:  past-due   account   charged  off  the   amount   of   $611.  Applicant
admitted this debt but testified he paid when he got his first job in 2019.  He identified the
specific branch he went to and paid it with a check. (Tr. at 52.) He explained he paid the
smaller debts whenever he had a little bit of extra money. The most recent credit report
shows the same outstanding balance and a last payment date of December 2019. (Tr. at
53 and GE-8 at 7.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.g: past-due account  charged off the  amount  of  $446. Applicant could
not recall what the debt was for. (Tr. at 53 and GE-3 at 2.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.h:  past-due   cellular  service   account   referred  for   collection   for
$1,090. Applicant offered nothing to support his denial. (GE-4 at 6 and GE-5 at 6.) This
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.i: past-due account  referred fo
r collection for $632.  Applicant denied
this allegation; however, it is supported by the Government’s information.  Applicant did
not offer any information to refute or mitigate this allegation. (GE-4 at 6 and GE-5 at 6.)
This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.j:  wage   garnishment   of   $5,040   for  child  support,  past-due  child
support, spousal support, and past-due spousal  support.  Applicant’s child  support
garnishment  was  triggered  when  his  wage  withholding  stopped  after  he  moved  and
changed  jobs.  He  has  since  coordinated  with  his  employers  to  avoid  payments  being
interrupted. (Tr. at 42-43 and GE-7 at 1.)
SOR ¶  2.a. Applicant admitted  in his Answer  to  being  counseled  in  August 2021
for leaving  overnight  an  unsecured  a  binder containing  a  password  to  a  classified  system.
(GE-6  at 1.) He provided  the  training  certificates he  completed  to mitigate his error. (AE-
A  through  AE-E.)  After  the  incident,  Applicant  stayed  on  with  the  company  for  almost a
year  before leaving  to  take a higher paying  position. (Tr. at  25-26.)
Applicant testified he filed his 2021 taxes and owed $14,000. He could not afford
to  pay  the  tax  bill. (Tr.  at  66.)  He  was  not  aware  of  his  tax  withholding  or  reporting
requirements for the side jobs he held as an independent contractor. He has not contacted
the IRS to establish a payment plan. (Tr. at 69, 74.) He testified he was in a car accident
and his car was severely damaged. He stopped making payments on the auto loan when
he  could  not  afford  the  $2,500  insurance  deductible.  The account  was  charged  off  for
$11,815 in April 2022. (Tr. at 53 and GE-8 at 10.) None of these debts were alleged in
the  SOR.  I  have  considered  the  evidence  of  these  delinquent  debts  for  the  limited
purposes of deciding which adjudicative guidelines are applicable, evaluating evidence
of mitigation, and as part of my whole-person analysis.

"Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  about  June  2018.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1988.
He is married without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 45, 49-50, 103; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  worked  as  a  civilian  employee  of  the  U.S.  military  from  2007  until  he
resigned pursuant to a settlement agreement in April 2018. He became a branch head
in  about  early  2016.  He  had  supervisory  responsibilities  within  the  section  (e.g.,
technical,  personnel,  facilities,  etc.).  He  coordinated  and  provided  funding  on  the
contract  for  contactor  personnel,  and  he  provided  feedback  to  the  contracting  officer
representative  (COR)  on  contractor  performance.  (Tr.  at  47-51,  105-107;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
In  October  2017,  a  female  contract  employee  (Ms.  A)  contacted  the  labor  and
employee  relations  office  to  report  inappropriate,  uncomfortable  and  physical  touching
and  comments  made  by  Applicant.  An  investigation  was  conducted,  and  a  report  was
issued in November 2017. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  was  a  single  mother  of  two  who  had  never  worked  outside  the  home
before  this  job.  English  is  her  second  language.  She  started  working  as  a  contract
employee  at  the  defense  facility  in  about  May  2016.  She  remained  after  another
company  took  over  the  contract  in  December  2016.  She  held  a  security  clearance  for
her job. (Tr. at 56, 108; GE 2)
Ms. A worked in a cubicle outside Applicant’s office. She reported that Applicant
made  repeated  inappropriate  suggestions  and  hugged  her,  which  she  perceived  as
uncomfortable and inappropriate. She  was concerned about her financial security, and
he told her that he was responsible for her salary because he managed her contract. He
promised that he would help convert her to a government employee. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  reported  that  about  six  months  into  her  employment,  Applicant  started
hugging her; asking her to turn full circle, commenting “nice” while nodding his approval
at  her  appearance;  asking  her  to  long  lunches  away  from  work;  and  closing  his  door
when he called her into his office. She stated that she was initially not offended by the
hugs,  but  they  eventually  made  her  uncomfortable.  She  voiced  her  objections  to  him,
but the comments and hugs continued. She stated that when she refused his hugs, he
became irritated, yelled at her, and often criticized her work. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  stated  that  Applicant  called  her  on  November  4,  2016,  and  asked  her  to
meet  him  at  a restaurant  for lunch.  She drove  to the restaurant,  but  it  was  closed.  He
drove them both to another restaurant where they had lunch. They walked around after
lunch. He then drove her to the airport  and parked. He said that he liked to watch the
planes take off. While there, he asked her if she wanted to be his girlfriend. She told him
no, and that she thought of him as a good boss and nothing more. He then got red and
appeared  angry.  She  asked  him  to  drive  her  to  her  car  so  that  she  could  go  back  to
work. Afterward, she called a friend who told her to document everything that happened.
She maintained a notebook about his subsequent actions. That is how she was able to
identify specific dates. (GE 2)
The  investigator  noted  that  a  Google  Maps  search  indicated  an  average  drive
time of 42 minutes from the facility to the restaurant; 22 minutes from the restaurant to
the airport; and 32 minutes from the airport to the facility. I believe the times to and from
the airport may be a bit skewed because it indicates travel to the airport when Applicant
indicated  that  they  were  in  a  parking  area  by  the  airport.  He  stated  the  trip  from  the
facility  to  the  restaurant  was  about  30  minutes,  and  the  airport  is  on  the  way.  Travel
times can vary greatly based on time of day and traffic conditions. I accept Applicant’s
travel  times.  The  investigator  noted  that  Applicant  signed  into  the  facility  at  0705  on
November 4, 2016, and signed out at 1705. (GE 2)
Ms. A reported that on November 7, 2016, Applicant called her into his office and
invited her to his home when his wife was not home, so that they could talk. She stated
that she told him no, and that it was not appropriate. She felt uncomfortable but did not
tell him. She just changed the subject. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  reported  that  on  November  21,  2016,  Applicant  called  her  into  his  office
and  stated  that  because  of  the  Thanksgiving  holiday,  he  would  not  see  her  for  a  few
days,  and  that  he  wanted  to  hug  her.  The  hug  made  her  uncomfortable.  He  made
“weird”  sounds  similar  to  moaning,  and  he  started  to  shake  or  shimmy.  The  following
week, she told him that the hugs made her uncomfortable, and she asked him to stop.
He  apologized  and  said  he  knew that  he  should  not  hug  her, but he  could  not  control
himself. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  stated  that  in  the  middle  of  the  day  in late  2016  or early  2017,  Applicant
asked her to go with him on an errand to buy a flag. He bought a flag and surprised her
on the way back to the facility and drove to his home. He asked her to come in and see
his Christmas tree. She refused and asked him to take her back to work, which he did
after about ten minutes. (GE 2)
Ms. A reported that on January 4, 2017, Applicant asked her to lunch. He asked
her to meet him at the stop sign around the corner of their building so that no one would
see them leave together. (GE 2)
Ms. A stated that in March 2017, Applicant called her into his office and told her
that he was responsible for funding her salary. He showed her on his computer how he
added funding to her contract. On one occasion after refusing a hug, he told her that he
had been a contractor once and was laid off. He suggested that she prepare a resume
in case it ever happened to her. (GE 2)
According  to  Ms.  A,  in  March  2017,  Applicant  told  her  that  he  learned  her
address from her resume and drove by her home while he was visiting a shooting range
in her vicinity. He told her how many telephone poles were on her street. He invited her
to go with him to a shooting range by her home. (GE 2)
In  May  2017,  Ms.  A  texted  Applicant  that  she  wanted  the  hugs  and  meetings
behind  closed  doors  to  stop.  He  did  not  hug  her  again  or  talk  to  her  with  the  door
closed, but he continued to ask her to lunch. He responded to her text:
Not  a  problem  at  all!  I’m  sorry  you  felt  uncomfortable.  I  only  gave  you  a
few hugs as a friend because you did that to me first and because you told
me  you  were  absolutely  ok  with  it.  Also,  I  was  not  upset  the  other  day
because  of  this  at  all.  I’m  glad  you  told  me!  I  want  you  to  be  completely
comfortable and happy. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  reported  that  in  about  June  2017,  she  shared  her  problems  with  the
employee  (Ms.  X)  in  the  next  cubicle.  She  asked  Ms.  X  not  to  tell  anyone  for  fear  it
would get back to Applicant. When questioned in the investigation, Ms. X reported that
in  the  summer  of  2017,  Ms.  A  walked  over  to  her.  She  was  visibly  crying  and  upset
about  something  that  happened  between  her  and  Applicant.  Ms.  X  denied  knowing
anything about why Ms. A was upset. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  also  shared  her  problems  with  her  COR,  who  responded  with  a  text  on
about June 16, 2017:
Good  Morning  [Ms.  A],  this  is  [COR’s  first  name]  so  lock  my  number  in
your  phone.  How  are  you  doing  today?  I  was  thinking  about  our
conversation we had yesterday and I have been thinking . . . DO NOT go
to  lunch  with  him  anymore  unless  it’s  in  a  group  setting.  Remember  to
document everything that happens no matter how small it might be. Also,
[Ms.  X]  said  you  don’t  want  information  shared  so  I’m  not  going  to  say
anything BUT if it gets to the point where it’s unbearable and you need to
take action then I have someone for you to talk to. I know she’s open and
will  help  you.  We  can  discuss  later  when  you’re  not  in  the  office  if  you
want. Don’t let this stress you to the point you end up getting sick. Stress
is a silent killer. (GE 2)
On  July 13,  2013,  Applicant emailed the  resumes of 16  job  applicants  to  Ms. A
with the instructions, “Please print these resumes out for me, and sort them according to
the  order  in  which  you  think  I  will  be  most  interested.  The  sort  criteria  should  be:
technical  relevance  followed  by  personality  (looking  for  mature,  determined  people).”
The  resumes  contained  personally  identifiable  information  (PII),  and  the  task  was
outside Ms. A’s scope of employment and need to know. (GE 2)
Ms.  A  was  informed  by  Applicant  on  September  8,  2017,  that  her  contract  was
not  being  renewed.  She  was  given  the  option  of  coming  to  the  facility  or  teleworking
until the end of the contract in October 2017. (GE 2)
Ms. A engaged in a series of texts with the COR over the weekend (September 8
and 9, 2017). The COR agreed to meet her on Monday. (GE 2)
In September 2017, Applicant drove to meet with the president of the contracting
company that employed Ms. A. He did not inform the COR of the meeting, and he did
not have the authority to interact with the president of the company. (GE 2)
On  September  14,  2017,  Applicant  sent  an  email  to  the  president  of  the
contracting  company.  He  dictated  tasks  to  be  assigned  to  Ms.  A  that  she  could
complete off-site. The COR was not copied on the email. (GE 2)
On  September  19,  2017,  Ms.  A  emailed  Applicant  and  the  president  of  her
company. She wrote that she would like to work in the facility in October 2017 instead of
teleworking. (GE 2)
On  September  20,  2017,  Applicant  sent  an  email  to  the  president  of  the
company:
[President’s  first  name];  I  can’t  dictate  this,  as  you  know,  but  for
informational  purposes  only,  my  preference  would  be  to  stay  with  the
original plan (i.e.. telework in October: in which case [Ms. A’s] last day on
site would be 29 Sep 17). Please let me know how you will approach this.
Any  communication  on  [Ms.  A’s]  schedule  will  need  to  come  from  you.
(GE 2)
On  September  28,  2017,  Ms.  A  went  to  the  division  head  (Mr.  B),  who  was
Applicant’s  supervisor,  and  presented  him  with  a  three-page  document  containing  her
interactions  with  Applicant.  She  stated  that  she  reached  out  to  the  Equal  Opportunity
Employment (EEO) office and asked hypothetically what would happen if someone filed
a claim such as hers. She was told the information would be reported to the department
head (Mr. B’s supervisor) and Mr. B. Ms. A stated that she did not want that to happen,
as she wanted the issue to remain between her and Applicant. Mr. B responded that by
bringing the information to him, he had a responsibility to report it. He asked her if she
did not want to escalate the situation, why she brought the issue to him. She replied, “I
really want a job.” He told her to telework for the rest of the week. (GE 2)
Mr.  B  spoke  with  Applicant  about  Ms.  A’s  statement.  Applicant’s  initial  reaction
appeared to be a combination of shock and embarrassment. He denied asking her to be
his girlfriend and going to her home. He admitted going to lunch with her and giving and
receiving  hugs.  He  denied  having  any  romantic  interest  in  her,  stating  that  he  was
happily married. (GE 2)
Mr. B reported that Applicant came to him and suggested that Mr. B have Ms. A’s
common access card (CAC) pulled after she was notified that her contract would come
to  an  end. Applicant told  Mr. B  that he  was concerned that  Ms.  A would  be emotional
about  losing  her  job  and  might  consider  sabotage,  because  high-level  private-sector
employees  sometimes  do  that  when  they  lose  their  job.  Applicant  also  stated  that  it
would  prevent  Ms.  A  from  coming  through  the  gate  and  becoming  disruptive.  Mr.  B
stated that pulling Ms. A’s CAC would not be appropriate as she needed it for her job,
and there was no indication that she was a threat. (GE 2)
Mr.  B  reported  that  he  had  known  Applicant  to  be  even  tempered  and  very
professional.  The  contract  associated  with  Ms.  A  was  scheduled  to  end  in  November
2017. There was no plan to renew the contract due to the lack of available funding, and
about  10  to  11  months  earlier,  the  division  hired  a  full-time  government  administrative
support  person  who  could  handle  some  issues  that  Ms.  A,  as  a  contract  employee,
could not. He stated that he had heard from Applicant and the administrative officer that
Ms. A’s work performance was not up to standard. Ms. A was informed that her contract
would be coming to an end. (GE 2)
The  administrative  officer  was  interviewed  for  the  investigation  on  October  4,
2017. She did not report any problems with Ms. A’s work, indicating the only comment
she  heard  from  any  employees  was  that  Ms.  A  was  talkative.  She  had  not  heard  any
negative  comments  from  Applicant  about  Ms.  A’s  work.  Applicant  informed  the
administrative  officer  that  he  was  ending  the  support  of  the  contract  due  to  funding
issues. (GE 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  the  investigation.  The  interview  and  his  security
clearance hearing testimony were consistent for the most part. He admitted that some
of  Ms.  A’s  statements  were  true,  and  he  vehemently  denied  others.  He  developed  a
“deeply  personal”  relationship  with  her.  They  discussed  marital  issues,  financial
problems,  and  their  families.  He  realizes  that  he  let  the  relationship  progress  beyond
what  he  should  have,  but  he  stated  that  he  had  no  romantic  interest  in  Ms.  A
whatsoever,  and  much  of  what  she  alleged  was  false.  He  stated  that  he  never  asked
her to be his girlfriend. (Tr. at 59-67, 73-74, 99, 120, 167-168; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  stated  that  he  hugged  Ms.  A  as  a  friend  about  8  to  12  times,  but  the
hugs  were  never  sexual  in  nature.  He  comes  from  a  physically  demonstrative  family,
and  he  hugs.  He  could  not  name  another  employee  that  he  hugged  behind  closed
doors. He completely denied any moaning sounds or shaking and shimmying when they
hugged. He stated that Ms. A initiated some of the hugs and made him uncomfortable,
but he hugged her to make her happy. In his February 2018 response to  the notice of
proposed removal, he stated that she told him in about September 2016 that she would
not mind if he kissed her, to which he refused.  He admitted in that response that they
hugged at least two times after she told him that he could kiss her. He testified that he
did not recall if he hugged her or invited her to lunch after she said he could kiss her. He
could not recall if she asked him to stop the hugs before he received the May 2017 text
message, but he stopped hugging her after the text message. He continued to ask her
to lunch. (Tr. at 61-66, 121-124, 130; Applicant’s response to SOR, Tab K; GE 2)
Applicant stated that he went to lunch with Ms. A about six times. He was asked
why he drove the distance to the one restaurant. He stated that it was a nice restaurant,
and  they  were  both  off  the  rest  of  the  day,  so  the  drive  was  less  important.  That  was
also  why  they  had  the  time  to  stop  by  the  airport.  He  stated  they  both  drove  to  the
restaurant and the lot outside the airport but sat in his car at the airport lot and talked.
He  admitted  that  he  told  her  that  he  was  having  marital  problems.  The  investigator
reported that he stated that he told Ms. A that he was thinking about finding a girlfriend.
Applicant   testified   that  he   did  not  tell   Ms.   A   that  he   was   thinking   about   finding   a
girlfriend, and  he  did not remember telling  the  investigator that  he  said that.  (Tr. at 68-
69; 126-128, 151-153, 156-161, 165-166; Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE  2)
The  investigator  reported  that  Applicant  signed  into  the  facility  at  0705  on
November 4, 2016 (the date identified by Ms. A as when they went to the restaurant and
airport), and signed out at 1705. Applicant testified that he never asked Ms. A to lunch
while he was on leave and away from  work. In Applicant’s February 2018 response to
the notice of proposed removal, he stated that he was on leave on November 4, 2016.
(Tr. at 157-159; Applicant’s response to SOR, Tab K; GE 2)
Applicant stated that he never asked Ms. A to come to his home, but he did drive
Ms. A to his house after lunch in a spur of the moment decision. His house was not too
far out of the way, and he drove by just so she could see the house. He is proud of his
Christmas  tree.  He  stated  that  he  never  planned  to  take  her  into  the  house,  but  he
decided to ask if she wanted to come in and see his Christmas tree. He stated that they
were in his driveway for less than two minutes. (Tr. at 74-78, 128; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant stated that he knew Ms. A’s address because they both looked it up on
Google Maps on his computer. He denied ever driving by her home. He stated that one
of Ms. A’s children was interested in archery, and he recommended the shooting range
near her home, because it offered archery classes. (Tr. at 78-80; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant admitted that in retrospect he should not have provided the resumes to
Ms.  A  to  review.  He  thought  it  was  acceptable  at  the  time  because  they  were  sent
encrypted, and they remained in  the office. Ms. A had a secret clearance. He realizes
that he provided her with PII that was beyond her need to know, and it was outside of
her scope of employment. (Tr. at 53-57, 102, 143-145, 163-164; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  show  Ms.  A  on  his  computer  how  he  added
funding to her contract, but he did show her a blank sample of how the process works,
in order to allay her financial fears. He stated that he told her that he would do his best
to  help  her  become  a  government  employee.  (Tr.  at  71-74,  117-119;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant testified that he talked with the COR before he took actions to end the
funding for Ms. A’s contract in the next fiscal year. The COR reported that she was not
told  about  the  meeting  with  the  president  of  the  contracting  company  until  after  the
meeting. Applicant asserted that the decision to not fund her contract was based on a
purely fiscal reason and was unrelated to his personal dealings with her. He drove the
10  to  15  miles  to  the  contractor’s  office  out  of  professional  courtesy.  Her  complaint
came after she was informed that her contract was ending. (Tr. at 84-99, 134-142, 155;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
I  did  not  find  Applicant’s  statement  during  the  investigation  nor his testimony  at
the hearing credible. Where his and Ms. A’s descriptions of the events differ, I find her
version to be more accurate.
Based  on  the  findings  in  the  investigation,  including  the  PII  breach  with  the
resumes,  Applicant  was  removed  from  federal  employment  for  conduct  unbecoming  a
federal  employee.  He  appealed  the  decision  with  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board
(MSPB).  A  settlement  was  reached  between  Applicant  and  the  agency  in  which  the
agency  agreed  to  withdraw  the  removal  action  in  return  for  Applicant’s  voluntary
resignation. He resigned in April 2018. (Tr. at 50-53; Applicant’s response to SOR, Tab
H-M; GE 2)
Applicant called two witnesses, and he submitted documents and letters attesting
to  his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his
technical  capabilities,  expertise,  professionalism,  trustworthiness,  diligent  handling  of
classified
reliability,  work  ethic,  honesty,
dedication,  and  integrity.  Individuals  who  have  known  and  supervised  him  for  many
years  indicated  that  the  alleged  behavior  is  completely  out  of  character  for  him.  He  is
recommended  for  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  at  17- 43;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations and
clarifications,  except  for  SOR  ¶  1.d.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old.  He  married  in  January  1994  and  divorced  in  August
2017  (he  and  his  wife  were  separated  at  various  times  between  2013  and  2017).  He
and his wife adopted two daughters who are now ages 24 and 21. The oldest daughter
(D1)  has  special  needs  and  is  unable  to  live  independently.  Applicant  provides  her
approximately  $1,200  in  monthly  support  payments.  Applicant’s  ex-wife  is  D1’s  legal
guardian  and  custodian.  Applicant  was  granted  weekend  visitation  privileges  and  D1
spends the weekends with him. (Tr. 53-55, 65-66, 87; GE 1)
Applicant  holds  a  master’s  degree.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a
federal  contractor,  for  five  years.  He  is  a  senior  software  engineer.  He  has  previously
worked  for  federal  contractors,  including  his  current  employer.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 1996. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  I,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant: (1) in  about 2002, was treated  by
Dr.  R,   who   diagnosed   him   with   depression   and   prescribed   antidepressant  medication;
(2) in  June   2013,  attempted   suicide   by  using   a   pressurized   nail   gun;  (3)  in  May  2017,
ceased  taking  his prescribed  antidepressant medication, without medical authorization,
and   thereafter  experienced   suicide   ideations   involving   use   of  a   nail   gun;  and   in  June
2021,  was  evaluated   by   a   licensed   psychologist  who   diagnosed   him   with   Major
Depressive  Disorder, recurrent, and  Autism Spectrum  Disorder, mild, without  intellectual
impairment. The  psychologist  opined  that  Applicant  exercised  questionable or impaired
judgment  when   in   an   emotionally  charged   social  and   interpersonal  situation.  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a  - 1.d)
Under Guideline  K,  the  SOR alleged  five  separate  security infractions  as follows:
(1)   in  May  2009   and   (2)   in  June   2015,  Applicant  brought  a   personal  cell   phone   into   a
secured  area; (3)  in May 2016, he  failed  to  properly log-off  of  a  classified  computer  in a
secured  area; (4) between  March  2018  and  December 2018, he brought unauthorized
electronic  devices  into a  secured  area  on  four separate occasions;  and (5) in  October
2019, he failed to properly secure a closed area. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a - 2.e)
Under Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  in  June  2014,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a
domestic  issue  where  the  police  became  involved  when  there  was  physical  contact
between Applicant and his wife; in June 2015,  Applicant was questioned by the police
about  stalking  a  member  of  his  medical  care  team;  and  in  October  2016,  he  was
arrested  and  charged  with  assaulting  his  wife  and  committing  child  abuse  on  his
daughter. All the  allegations  listed under  Guidelines  I  and  K  were-cross  alleged  under
Guideline E. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a - 3.e)
Psychological Conditions.
Applicant admitted being diagnosed in 2002 with depression. He was prescribed
antidepressant medication by a doctor. During his June 2021, mental health evaluation
conducted  by  Dr.  N,  at  the  request  of  the  DOD,  he  indicated  he  was  prescribed
medication for depression as early as 1985 or 1986. (Tr. 59-60; GE 4)
Applicant attempted to commit suicide in 2013 after he had been diagnosed with
cancer in 2010 and believed he only had a few years to live. He explained that he was
concerned  about  his  family  and  thought  that  a  $350,000  life  insurance  policy,  which
expired in a few days, could provide financial support for his family upon his death. He
used a pressured nail gun in this instance. He further stated that his equipment failed.
He testified that he never actually pointed the gun at himself, but he thought about doing
so. In his September 2013 security clearance application (SCA), he used the words “my
failed suicide attempt” to describe his actions that day. (Tr. 60-61, 89-90; GE 3)
During  his  December  2017  background  interview,  Applicant  admitted  to  having
suicidal ideations using his nail gun. He was concerned enough about his thoughts that
he gave the nail gun to a friend to hold for him.  In his interview, he stated that he had
these thoughts because he had stopped taking his medication. He did so by not getting
his  prescriptions  refilled.  He  was  consciously  trying  to  see  how  he  could  get  along
without the medication.  During his testimony, he  claimed that his medication stoppage
was due to a mix-up by his insurance company. He stated this one-month stoppage was
unintentional  by  him.  Applicant  believes  these  circumstances  occurred  in  2018,  as
opposed to May 2017, as alleged in the SOR. His belief is based upon an email he sent
to his employer advising that he had called a suicide prevention hotline. He continues to
take the medications listed in AE S. (Tr. 61-64; GE 7; AE S-T)
In   June   2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated   by  a   licensed   psychologist,  Dr.  N,  who
was  approved   by   the   DOD.  For  his  assessment,   Dr.  N   reviewed   Applicant’s   record,
conducted  testing,  and  performed  a  two-hour  clinical interview  with  Applicant. Applicant
told  Dr.  N  of  his  2013   aborted   suicide   attempt.  He  also  described   his  2017   suicidal
ideations  when he  intentionally went off  his antidepressant medication.  Applicant denied
any current suicidal ideations or depressive symptoms.  Dr. N diagnosed  Applicant using
the   Diagnostic  and   Statistical   Manual   of  Mental  Disorders,  5th  edition   (DSM-5)  with
“Major  Depressive  Disorder,  recurrent”;  “Autism  Spectrum  Disorder,  mild,  without
accompanying  intellectual  impairment.”  Dr.  N  concluded  absent  effective  therapy,  it
would  be  reasonable  to  expect  that  Applicant  might  demonstrate  impaired  judgment
when  his  emotions  run  high  in  the  future,  as  has  occurred  in  the  past  in  social  and
interpersonal  situations.  Applicant  last  saw  a  counselor  in  2019  for  approximately  two
months when he was going through the guardianship issue with his ex-wife. Dr. N gave
Applicant a “fair” prognosis. (Tr. 67, 112-113, 118; GE 4)
In December 2021, Applicant participated in and paid for a second psychological
evaluation. This evaluation was conduct by Dr. B, a licensed psychologist. There is no
evidence  to  indicate  whether  Dr.  B  was  “acceptable  to  and  approved  by  the  U.S.
Government.”  Dr.  B  conducted  a  clinical  interview  with  Applicant,  put  him  through  a
series of tests, and conducted a chart review. Applicant reported current difficulties with
anger  and  irritability.  This  anger  is  directed  at  others.  Dr.  B  diagnosed  Applicant  with
Persistent  Depressive  Disorder,  Social  Anxiety  Disorder,  and  Complex  Trauma  (by
history). Dr. B encouraged Applicant to consider counseling services, which would help
the re-orientation of depression, self-esteem issues, and functional difficulties. Dr. B did
not  offer  a  prognosis  for  Applicant.  In  April  2023,  Dr.  B  supplemented  her  earlier
assessment by clarifying that while Applicant could benefit from life skills coaching and
ongoing executive function, it was not a “necessity” for him to do so. (Tr. 68; AE I, X)
Protected Information.
Applicant  admitted  that  between  2009  and  2019,  he  committed  eight  different
security  violations.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.b,  2.d) Six  of  the  violations  involved  similar  conduct
when  he  inadvertently  took  his  cell  phone,  or  similar  electronic  device,  into  a  secure
area  without  proper  authorization  in  2009,  2015,  and  four  times  between  March  and
December  2018.  The  violations  did  not  involve  disclosure  of  classified  information.
Applicant  self-reported  all  these  violations.  He  received  retraining  after  the  violations.
After  the  last  2018  violation,  he  was  given  a  written  warning  that  additional  violations
could result in disciplinary action. (Tr. 68, 71; GE 6; SOR answer; AE U)
The two remaining security violations occurred when Applicant failed to properly
log-off  a  classified  computer  in  May  2016.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  distracted
away  from  the  logged-in  computer  and  forgot  to  come  back  to  log-out.  This  was  an
inadvertent  violation  and  no  spillage  occurred.  In  October  2019,  Applicant  was
responsible  for  securing  a  closed  lab  area.  He  set  the  alarm  but  failed  to  properly
secure  the  door.  He  told  a  background  investigator  that  he  must  have  “spaced  out”
securing the door. This violation was discovered by security personnel. He has not had
another security incident since the one in October 2019. (Tr. 68, 74, 114; GE 7 (p. 20);
SOR answer; AE U)
Applicant  explained  that  his  behavior  that  resulted  in  these  eight  security
incidents was heavily influenced by various distractions going on in his personal life at
the  time.  These  distractions  included  his divorce  proceedings,  which  initially  started  in
2013,  but  were  protracted,  and  ended  in  his  final  divorce  in  September  2017.
Additionally, he was involved in a contentious guardianship battle with  his ex-wife over
physical  custody  of  his  adult  special-needs  daughter.  He  sought  the  services  of  a
counselor  when  he  was  going  through  the  guardianship  process.  The  guardianship
action began sometime in 2019 and ended with a judge’s order naming Applicant’s ex-
wife the primary legal guardian for their daughter in February 2020. He testified that he
does  not  have  these  distractions  present  in  his  life  now  and  is  confident  that  future
security incidents will not occur. (Tr. 75, 115-116, 118)
Personal Conduct.
SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.b  cross-allege  conduct  also  alleged  under  the  psychological
conditions  and  handling  protected  information  guidelines.  The  facts  involving  those
allegations are stated above and will not be repeated here.
Applicant admitted that the police were called to his home in June 2014. He was
not  arrested  and  no  charges  resulted.  He  was  brushing  D1’s  teeth  when  he  and  his
then-wife  got  into  an  argument.  He  claims  that  she  slapped  him  and  he  pushed  her
down.  He  made  sure  he  protected  her  landing  using  his  hands  and  body.  (Tr.  75-77,
SOR answer)
In   June   2015,  Applicant  was  questioned   by   the   police   looking   into   a   complaint
that   he   was  stalking   or  harassing   a   hospital   staff   member   who   had   previously  treated
him. Applicant admitted  this happened. He  received  treatment at a  local hospital in June
2015  and  noticed  one  of the  female  treatment team  members.  He decided  he  wanted  to
talk with   her and   possibly   have   coffee   or lunch   with   her.  He   did   not  approach  her   that
day. A  few days later, he  returned  to  the  hospital with  the  intent  to  talk  with  this woman.
After waiting  for about   an   hour, he   was  approached   by a   nurse   seeking   to   assist  him.
He   explained   he   wanted   to   talk   to   the   female.   The   nurse  explained   that  the   other
woman   was  happily  married   and   Applicant   left  the   hospital.  Sometime   later,  he   wrote
the  woman  a  letter where he  expressed  his  feelings  for  her  and  explained  that  he  was  in
a  loveless marriage. He delivered  it to  the  hospital and  left.  A  few days later he  received
a  call  from  a  police  officer. The  officer explained  the  law regarding  stalking  and  warned
him  from  contacting the  women again. After a  few more days,  Applicant decided  to  write
the  women  an  apology  letter. He met  with  the  police  officer again and  the  officer refused
to  take  the  women  his  apology letter and  advised  him  not to  send  it. The  woman  sent
Applicant a  text  and  in  no  uncertain  terms told  him  that  she  never wanted  to  see  or  hear
from  him  again.  Since  that time, there has been  no  further interaction  with  her. (Tr. 77-
78, 98; GE 7  (  pp. 16-17))
Applicant admitted that in October 2016, he was  arrested for assaulting his wife
and committing child abuse-no injury toward his youngest daughter (D2). Applicant and
his then-wife got into an argument concerning a note he had written. She possessed the
note  in  her  hand  and  he  tried  to  wrestle  it  away.  He  eventually  bit  her  hand.  D2  was
present  during  this  altercation  and  called  the  police.  Applicant  was  arrested  and
charged  with  assault  and  non-injury  child  abuse  (because  D2  was  present  and
witnessed his assault). He pleaded guilty to a lesser assault charge and the remaining
charges  were  dropped.  His  sentence  included  12  months  of  unsupervised  probation,
mandatory attendance at 12 anger management classes, 8 parenting classes, fines and
fees.  He  completed  his  probation  requirements  without  any  violations.  He  has  had  no
other incidents involving his ex-wife or daughters. (Tr. 78-82, 104; GE 7 (pp. 9-10); AE
D)
Character Evidence/Performance Reviews.
Applicant  presented   the   testimony   of   two   witnesses   who   were  coworkers   (who
also  wrote   letters  of   support)  and   letters  of   support  from   two   of   his  sisters  and   one
additional  coworker.  One   coworker  and   former  supervisor  worked   with   Applicant   from
2019  to  2020. He is aware  of all  the  SOR allegations.  He held a  clearance  for 33  years
before he  retired  in 2021.  He  stated  that Applicant is a  very good  software  engineer. He
believes  that  the  security  incidents  were  minor and  Applicant  has learned  from  them  so
that  they  should   not   happen   in   the   future.  He  believes   Applicant  is  honest  and
trustworthy  and  has no  concerns with  him  possessing  a security  clearance.  (Tr. 16, 20-
25; AE E)
Applicant’s  second  witness  worked  with  Applicant  from  1997  to  2013.  He  has
held a clearance for 35 years. He is also a retired naval reserve officer. He is aware of
the SOR allegations. During his work experience with Applicant, he was professional in
his  job  performance,  very  intelligent,  and  always  protected  classified  information.  He
was  not  concerned  about  Applicant’s  past  security  infractions  because  he  was  going
through  personal  events  at  the  time  that  are  no  longer  present.  He  is  aware  that
Applicant’s  care  and  concern  for  D1  caused  additional  stress  in  his  life.  He  has  not
worked with Applicant since 2013. (Tr. 39-40, 43-47, 51; AE E)
Applicant’s  third  coworker wrote  that  during  the  time  they  worked  together from
2004 to 2007, Applicant had no security incidents. His two sisters wrote that Applicant is
very intelligent and honest. He has never revealed any work details to them. (AE E)
Applicant provided three years of his work performance appraisals (2020-2022).
In 2020, he was given an overall rating of “achieved/substantially achieved.” In 2021, his
supervisor noted that Applicant improved his relationships with coworkers and managed
his time better. In 2022, his supervisor noted that Applicant was directed to apologize to
a  team  member  for  comments  he  made.  His  supervisor  also  noted  his  concern  over
Applicant’s  “attitude  behavior.”  Applicant  was  also  asked  to  prioritize  his  life  situations
so outside pressures or situations are not projected into his work environment. (AE F)
Applicant  provided  information  about  coworkers’  positive  comments  during  his
current employment. He also provided information on other aspects of his personal life
reflected in many of his exhibits. (AE A, C, G, J-R, V-X)
",True
"Having   thoroughly  considered   the   evidence   in  the   record,  I  make   the   following
findings  of  fact:   Applicant  is  51   years  old.  He   enlisted   in  the   Marine   Corps  in  August
1990.  He served  in  Desert Storm,  Desert Shield, Operation  Restore Hope,  31st  Marine
Expeditionary Unit (MEU) out of Okinawa, Japan, and  on  two  sea  service  deployments
throughout  Southwest   Asia.   He  earned  a   master’s  degree   in  2007   from   the   Naval
Postgraduate   School  in   information   technology  management  (ITM).  He  retired   with   an
honorable  discharge  in  July  2011  at the  rank of  staff  sergeant. His decorations  include
the   Meritorious   Service  Medal,  Navy   Commendation   Medal,   and
three   Navy
Achievement Medals. He has an  extensive  background  in IT and  various certifications.
Applicant  was   married   in  1994   and   subsequently   divorced   in   2018.  He   has  an   adult
daughter, and a  son, age 17.  (Tr. 12-13, 23-25; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  was  hired  in  February  2014  by  a  government  contractor  as  an
operations  manager.  One  of  his  responsibilities  was  to  ensure  that  the  company’s  IT
operations  ran  smoothly.  He  held  a  DOD  security  clearance  in  this  position.  Under
Guideline  M  (Use  of  Information  Technology),  SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant,  while
employed  in  this  position  and  without  the  chief  executive  officer’s  (CEO)  approval,
obtained and utilized access to his employer’s network drives, which contained the co-
owners’ personal information, as well as corporate sensitive information. (Tr. 23, 25-29;
GE 4)
Applicant testified at the hearing that he  had asked the co-owner  (minority owner)
of the company  for  system  administrator access  through  an  email  communication, with
the  CEO  copied  on  the  email. In about June  2014, he  was granted  system  administrator
access   in  order to   perform   a   network  assessment.   He admitted  that  with   administrator
access   he   had   admittance   to   the   owners’   personal   information   and   any   company
proprietary  information  that was  saved  on  any of the  drives  on  the  network.  He  denied
this  allegation   in  his  SOR  Answer  because   he   did  not  use   or  take   any  proprietary  or
sensitive information.  Applicant  also adamantly  denied  in his SOR  Answer ever having
system  administrator access, which  would  have  prevented  him  from  doing  some  of the
activities  alleged  in the  SOR.  This information  contradicts his testimony.  (Tr. 30-31, 51-
52)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant, without being tasked to do so, gave an outside
vendor and personal friend/acquaintance, access to his employer’s network and allowed
the  vendor  to  install hardware/software  devices  on  the  network  without  prior  approval.
He did not obtain a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) from the vendor before giving the
vendor access to sensitive company data.
In  June  2014,  Applicant  hired  vendor  (A  to  come  to  the  business  where  the
vender  installed  software  and  hardware  (Infoblox)  to  access  the  network  to  ensure
cyber compliance and to perform network hardening, or the testing of vulnerabilities on
the  company’s hard  drives.  Applicant  was familiar  with  the person who  worked for the
software  company,  but  not  the  vendor  who  used  the  software.  After  the  vendor
performed  these  services,  Applicant  admitted  the  CEO  claimed  that  he  had  not  been
given  authorization  to  have  a  vendor  perform  specific  tasks  during  the  network
assessment. He stated that he had been clear during weekly work meetings of his intent
to hire vendor A to access the company’s network. He was present with the vendor the
entire  time  they  were  on  location  performing  these  tasks.  The  vendor  tested  for
vulnerabilities across the network and provided recommendations on how to harden the
network.  He  was  not  aware  that  he  was  supposed  to  obtain  an  NDA  from  the  vendor
since he thought NDAs were only needed in business development. Applicant admitted
he  used  the  system  administrator  status  he  was  granted  so  the  vendor  could  perform
these tests. He testified that he held the system administrator rights for about two weeks
in June 2014. (Tr. 32-36, 50-52; GE 4)
A  government  witness,  Mr.  Z,  with  31  years  of  IT  experience  and  who  also
provided IT services to the federal contractor through his company, testified that a few
weeks before Applicant resigned from his employment, Mr. Z was tasked with reviewing
and  monitoring  the  government  contractor’s  network  to  determine  if  any  company
documents were lost or if any data was transferred from the company’s network. Mr. Z
testified  that  he  managed  all  the  rights,  permissions,  and  access  to  data  on  the
company’s network. He did not grant system administrator privileges to Applicant, but in
May 2014, he did grant vendor A full access through a temporary system administrator
account. Applicant was also able to have system administrator access via the temporary
account  that  was  to  be  used  only  by  the  vendor.  He  stated  that  Applicant  used  the
temporary  account  access  privileges  from  May  2014  until  late  September  2014,  when
an  employee  reported  that  Applicant  had  complete  domain  administrator  privileges
because Applicant had given him the account access password. Mr. Z testified that the
security manager immediately requested that he remove Applicant’s access through the
temporary account created for the vendor. (Tr. 18, 97-99, 101-103, 105-107; GE 2, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  on  January  14,  2015,  Applicant  downloaded  his
information  regarding  the
employer’s  proprietary
employer’s owners, and project data related to one or more government contracts.  He
saved approximately 7 GB of data to a personal Dropbox and then deleted evidence of
the activity from his work laptop.
information,  sensitive  personal
Applicant testified this event occurred about a month before he left this place of
employment.  He  stated  that  he  installed  a  Dropbox  account  due  to  employees  having
difficulty  obtaining  information  from  the  company  drives.  This  Dropbox  allowed  project
employees  access  to  information  while  there  were  at  their  customer  worksites.  The
information he placed in the Dropbox was necessary for the employees to perform their
job duties, and he said the Dropbox was in full compliance with IT rules and regulations.
He did not recall asking for permission to set up the Dropbox account but stated he had
provided  notice  during  the  weekly  meetings  that  he  was  going  to  do  so.  He  started
moving data  into the Dropbox, which he claimed was  a  secure environment, using  his
work e-mail. He worked out of the conference room on a regular basis and sometimes
turned off the lights to take advantage of the natural lighting. As soon as the CEO found
out  that  he  had  completed  this  task,  she  got  extremely  upset,  and  he  immediately
deleted the information he had placed into the Dropbox. (Tr. 36-45, 62-64; GE 2)
Mr. Z testified that the night of January 14, 2015, just before Applicant departed
from  his  employment,  he  was  accessing  files  from  the  company’s  server  at  4:20  p.m.
The forensic evidence showed that about 7 GB of data was transferred onto Applicant’s
laptop in his Dropbox account. Mr. Z stated that the Dropbox was not a secure or proper
way  to  handle  the  transference  of  sensitive  information.  The  office  video  camera
footage showed that at 6:26 p.m., Applicant turned off the lights in the conference room
while  waiting  for  the  data  to  migrate.  At  7:04  p.m.,  Applicant  deleted  the  Dropbox
content from his laptop with encryption to prevent detection. Security video footage also
showed that Applicant then turned on the lights, activated the building’s security alarm,
and  exited  the  building  with  his  personal  belongings  in  hand.  Based  on  the  forensic
evidence found by Mr. Z during an examination of Applicant’s work laptop, the CEO filed
an  incident  report  against  Applicant.  She  accused  Applicant  of  downloading  company
proprietary information and sensitive personal information concerning the owners of the
company,  and  project  data  related  to  one  or  more  government  contracts  that  was
possibly considered Controlled Technical Information. On this day, Applicant moved the
data into a personal Dropbox account on his work laptop using his personal email, and
then he deleted the trail from his laptop that same evening with the use of File Sanitizer,
which  was  used  to  permanently  delete  files.  Less  than  a  week  after  this  incident,
Applicant  submitted  his  letter  of  resignation  to  the  company.  The  detailed  analysis  of
forensic  data  recovered  from  Applicant’s  laptop  was  provided  to  the  Defense  Security
Service and the FBI. (Tr. 107-112; GE 2, 3, 4)
Due  to  this  incident,  in  April  2015,  the  security  manager  of  the  government
contractor  contacted  their  customer  on  a  government  contract  to  self-report  a  security
incident  concerning  their  former  employee.  The  security  manager  informed  their
customer  that  Applicant  had  downloaded  sensitive  information  regarding  the  contract,
and requested further direction from the customer. (GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  violated  his  employer’s  IT  policies  when  he
used  his  work  laptop  to  download  or  access  pornographic  material.  Applicant  testified
that  he  was  not  aware  that  he  had  accessed  pornography  on  his  work  laptop,  but  he
takes  accountability  for  this  transgression.  “I'm  not  saying  I  didn't  do  it.  I'm  just  not
aware  of  it.”  He  testified  that  he  would  never  download  porn  but  he  could  have
accessed porn on his work laptop. He was aware that he should generally not access
pornography on a work laptop, but he was not aware of any specific rule or policy that
prohibited  such  conduct.  He  was  not  aware  that  porn  sites  were  notorious  for  having
viruses or malware. (Tr. 46, 77-78; GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  “enabled”  or  tampered  with  “HP  Protect”
security  software on his laptop  in  violation of company policy. Applicant  stated that he
did use HP Protect to wipe the work computer when he was departing his employment
in February 2015, which he thought was an acceptable practice at most companies. He
denied installing HP Protect on his work computer because he believed it was already
preloaded  onto  his  work  computer.  He  did  not  admit  to  wiping  his  computer  clean  on
more than one occasion, but he did admit he did so at the end of his employment. (Tr.
36-45, 47-49; 62-64; GE 2, 4)
Mr. Z testified that wiping a computer clean is a red flag for IT professionals that
someone  is  trying  to  hide  something  on  their  computer.  Wiping  a  computer  before
departing a place of employment is also not a common practice within the industry. He
testified that a standard user should not have access to do a factory reset of the work
computer  unless  they  had  administrator  rights.  When  a  laptop  is  returned  by  an
employee, all that is needed is to wipe out the user’s profile. There is no need to initiate
a  complete  wipe  of  the  computer.  Mr.  Z said  that  Applicant  had  completed  a  previous
wipe  to  his  work  laptop  in  either  July  or  August  2014,  in  addition  to  the  wipe  he
performed in February 2015, based on his forensic analysis. Mr. Z was able to recover
most of the deleted data on Applicant’s laptop by using R-Studio, and other applications
in  his  forensic  examination.  He  determined  that  Applicant  had  been  able  to  do  many
activities that a standard IT user would not be able to do. (Tr. 108-117; GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  Applicant  created  multiple  usernames  and  passwords
without  IT  or  CEO  permission  in  violation  of  company  policy.  Applicant  stated  this
incident  stemmed  from  the  time  he  hired  a  vendor  to  perform  system  checks  and
vulnerabilities  on  the  company’s  network.  He  created  multiple  usernames  and
passwords  so  that  the  system  screenings  could  be  performed.  Another  employee
reported  to the  security  manager  in  September 2014  that Applicant  had  given  him  the
system administration password. The security manager contacted Mr. Z and requested
that Applicant’s system administrator access be removed immediately. When Applicant
was questioned about this incident, he stated; “I don’t really understand the context, so
it’s hard for me to say.” (Tr. 50-52; GE 4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant installed unauthorized software on his company
laptop  in  violation  of  company  policy.  Department  Counsel  acknowledged  this  SOR
allegation  somewhat  overlapped  with  the  allegation  of  Applicant  installing  or using  HP
Protect  software.  Applicant  stated  in  his  SOR  response  “I  did  not  utilize,  nor  was  I
afforded  system  administration  or  network  administration  right  in  any  capacity  of  my
job.”  This  sentiment  is  repeated  several  times  in  his  SOR  Answer.  His  testimony
indicated  he  was granted  system  administrator  privileges for approximately two  weeks
in June  2014  by  the  minority owner.  Applicant explained  previously that  the  HP Protect
software   was  already   preloaded   on   his  work  computer,  but  the   IT  provider,  Mr.  Z,
testified   that  he   deleted   all   applications  of   HP  Protect  from   all   of  the   work  laptops
provided  to  government contractor employees. When  I specifically asked  Applicant if  he
had  downloaded  HP Protect,  which  was used  to  wipe  his laptop,  his response  was;  “No,
not  that  I'm   aware   of.”   He  denied   knowledge   of   the   File  Shredder   on  his  laptop,  and
explained   that  the  Dropbox account  was   not   software   but  was  actually   “a   link  to   go   to
the  internet”  in  order to  interface  with  an  encrypted  site, like  a  cloud.  (Tr. 47,  52-54, 56-
57; SOR Answer; GE  4)
Mr.  Z testified  that the federal contractor did not utilize  Dropbox. He  stated  that
government contractors are not permitted to store any information on the cloud unless it
is  an  approved  government  cloud,  such  as  DOD  SAFE,  for  instance.  He  also  pointed
out that if an employee needed Dropbox, they would use their work email address and
create  the  account.  Applicant  did  not  use  his  work  email  address.  Applicant  used  his
personal account when using Dropbox on his computer. Mr. Z stated that the analysis of
the Dropbox  not only showed the  contractor’s  data  was stored there,  but also  showed
data Applicant had taken from a previous employer. Mr. Z stated, “so, we see a pattern
here.” (Tr. 117-122; GE 4)
SOR ¶  1.h  alleges that  Applicant disabled  or  failed  to  run  virus protection  on  his
work  laptop,  which   resulted   in  malware  virus  infestation   of  his  local  profile.   He  denied
this allegation  in  his Answer and  again during  his testimony.  When questioned  about  his
access  to  porn  websites to  view pornography, I asked  Applicant  whether it  was  common
knowledge   in  the   IT  industry  that  many  of  these   porn   websites  contained   viruses  or
malware.  Applicant  answered  that  he  was not aware  of this  information.  (Tr. 54-55, 77-
78; SOR Answer; GE  4)
Mr.  Z logged into Applicant’s  work laptop and  discovered  that  there  was  not  an
active  virus  defense  application  installed.  A  full  scan  of  the  computer  revealed  Trojan
viruses and malware in the local profile used by Applicant. Mr. Z had to have the viruses
and  malware  removed  before  a  detailed  analysis  of  Applicant’s  laptop  could  be
completed.  Mr.  Z  also  noted  that  accessing  pornographic  websites  could  have
contributed to the viruses and malware on the laptop. (GE 4)
Applicant departed employment with the federal contractor in February 2015 and
started  a  franchise.  He  testified  that  the  franchise  did  not  interfere  or  overlap  with  the
business of his former employer. He operated the franchise for five years while he also
worked concurrently as a sales director for another company. Since 2018, Applicant has
served as a vice president of his current company, and he is requesting a DOD security
clearance  be  granted  so  he  can  perform  specific  job  duties.  (GE  1;  Tr.  12-13,  22-23;
SOR Answer)
Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  alleged  Guideline  K  (Handling  Protected  information)
security  concerns,  and  it  cross-alleged  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c.  Applicant  denied  that  he
mishandled  protected  information  in  any  way.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  Paragraph  3  of  the  SOR
alleged Guideline E (Personal Conduct) security concerns, as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that in approximately August 2014, Applicant refused a direct
order  from  the  CEO  to  lay  off  an  employee.  Applicant  admitted  this  information  in  his
Answer. Instead of laying off the employee, he stated that the CEO wanted him to fire
the  female  employee  for  a  dress  code  violation,  specifically,  for  a  skirt  that  was  too
short.  Applicant  determined  that  this  employee  was  not  in  violation  of  company  policy
and  refused  to  fire  the  employee.  A  meeting  followed,  and  the  CEO  again  asked
Applicant to fire the employee. Applicant stated that he refused because the female was
not his employee and because he believed that both owners of the company were also
in  violation of  the  dress  code policy.  Applicant  denied that  he had a  close  relationship
with this employee, but he did acknowledge she was hired to work for his franchise after
he left the government contractor. The CEO reported that Applicant was asked to lay off
the employee due to lack of contract work, and he refused. (Tr. 64-69; GE 5)
SOR  ¶  3.b  alleges  that  in  approximately  August  2014,  Applicant  informed  the
company’s security officer that he already had possession of all of his employer’s data.
Applicant  denied  this  information.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  any  data  that  he
maintained was for the normal performance of his employment duties. He testified that
because  he  did  not  have  system  administrative  rights,  he  denied  that  he  had  “full”
access to all of the company’s data. (Tr. 69-70; GE 5)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges that while Applicant was the sole administer of his employer’s
LinkedIn account, he allowed, or caused, the employer’s page to be changed or redirect
visitors to Applicant’s new startup company, rather than the federal contractor. Applicant
admitted  setting  up  his  employer’s  LinkedIn  account.  After  his  departure,  he  was  not
aware  he  was  the  sole  person  who  retained  rights  to  the  LinkedIn  account.  Once  the
human  resources  director  contacted  him  about  this  matter,  he  immediately  provided
access  and  privileges  to  his  previous  employer.  His  testimony  was  that  this  was  a
misunderstanding and in no way intentional. (Tr. 70-72; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 3.d cross-alleged all of the information  cited  under Paragraphs 1  and 2.
Applicant denied this information.
Character Evidence
Applicant called a former colleague who had worked with him while employed by
the  same  government  contractor.  The  individual  said  he  felt  compelled  to  testify  on
behalf  of  Applicant  because  after  he  left  this  same  employer  in  early  2016,  the
company’s  CEO  also  falsely  charged  him  with  many  of  the  same  accusations  they
made about Applicant after his departure in February 2015. The witness believed these
were  company  tactics  to  prevent  employees  from  competing  with  the  company’s
business. He clarified that his role in this company was business development, and he
was  not  involved  in  IT.  He  also  admitted  that  he  continued  to  develop  business  after
leaving  this  employment,  and  the  federal  contractor  was  successful  in  preventing  him
from pursuing business with a contact he had developed. The witness also testified that
he has worked on many projects with Applicant, and Applicant’s business and personal
actions  were  always  beyond  reproach.  He  recommended  that  Applicant  be  granted  a
DOD security clearance. (Tr. 82-93; AE F, G)
Applicant  also  provided  character-reference  letters  from  a  previous  employee,
supervisor, and the president of the federal contractor that currently employs Applicant.
The  general  sense  of  the  character  evidence  is  that  he  is  diligent,  professional,
productive,  reliable,  and
important
contributions to warfighters’ mission. His character statements support reinstatement of
his security clearance. (AE C, D, E)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 4.c, 4.d, 4.h,
4.i, 4.j, 4.l, 4.m, and 4.n with clarifications. He denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a,
2.b,  2.c,  3.a,  4.a,  4.b,  4.e,  4.f,  4.g,  4.k,  and  4.o.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided  mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  who  has  worked  for  a  government
contractor in that position for almost six years. (Tr. 7, 10, 34) In 1991, he graduated from
high school. (Tr. 7) He served in the Navy from 1993 to 2013; his specialty was avionics
technician; and he honorably retired as a chief petty officer. (Tr. 8; SOR response) He
has a 100 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 8)
Seventy  percent  of  his  disability  rating  is  for  bipolar  disorder.  (Tr.  8,  60)  In  2018,  he
received a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 8)
Applicant’s first marriage was from 2000 to September 2011. (Tr. 9) In March 2012,
he  married  Ms. G;  however, he  said  he  has  not  seen  Ms.  G  since  June  of  2013. (Tr. 9)
He was unsure whether Ms. G  had  filed  for divorce.  (Tr. 9, 36) He  did not take  any action
to obtain a divorce. (Tr. 37) He believed she  has been with  another man since 2016. (Tr.
9)  He has two children with his first wife who are ages 11 and 23, and he said he did not
have  any children with  Ms. G. (Tr. 9-10, 38)
Personal Conduct
Foreign  Influence
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  is married  to  Ms.  G,  who  a  citizen and  resident of
Peru. He repeatedly and deliberately failed to disclose this relationship to the government,
as  required.  SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  he  failed  to  disclose  his  intimate  relationship  with  a
Peruvian national (Ms. G) to his command while enlisted in the Navy.
In July 2010, Applicant met Ms. G when he was in Peru. (Tr. 41)  In September
2012,  he  informed  the  Navy  of  his  marriage  to  Ms.  G.  (Tr.  21-22)  The  marriage  was
documented in his Navy personnel records. (Tr. 35, 53; SOR response, Attach. 2)
The last time Applicant was in Peru was in 2013, and the last time he saw Ms. G
was in 2013. (Tr. 38-40) He did not communicate with her from 2016 to 2018. (Tr. 29-40)
From about 2018 to 2021, he talked to her about twice a week, and the last time he talked
to her was in 2021. (Tr. 39-41) He denied her requests for funds during the 2018 to 2021
time period. (Tr. 41)
Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges on  March 9, 2021, Dr. E, a  psychologist, evaluated  Applicant
and  concluded  he  had  “demonstrated  a  pattern  of rule-violating  behavior, poor judgment,
and  dishonesty that could reasonably and  significantly diminish  his trustworthiness and
judgment in a national security context.”
Dr. E evaluated Applicant as requested by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications
Facility  (CAF),  which  is  the  predecessor  organization  for  the  DCSA  CAS.  (GE  4)  He
diagnosed  Applicant  with  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  severe,  in  partial  remission,  most  recent
episode  manic;  Other  Specified  Anxiety  Disorder  (with  symptoms  of  agoraphobia  and
panic); and Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate, in sustained remission. (Id. at 7) Dr. E listed
the materials he considered for his evaluation of Applicant; however, he did not mention
consideration of VA treatment records or other recent records of mental-health treatment.
Dr. E provided a detailed description of Applicant’s mental health and professional history,
which  was  primarily  based  on  Applicant’s  statements,  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative
Service  (NCIS)  report,  and  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  interviews.  Dr.  E
concluded:
[Applicant]  went  on  trips to  Peru  with  the  attitude  of “Screw  it! What  are they
going  to  do  to  me?” His view is that all  the  allegations pertaining  to  him  lying
about various matters were “trumped  up stuff.”
It   is  possible  that  [Applicant’s]  command   was  not  supportive   of  him   and
developed   a   negative   view  of  him   due   to   his  medical  and   behavioral
problems. However, based  on  the  totality of the  information  available to  me,
my impression  is that [he] is [a] person  who  is willing  to  violate  rules if he
believes he  can  do  so  without being  discovered  and  if doing  so  helps him
attain an  objective. If  he  is discovered, he  seems to  be  a  person  who  adopts
unsophisticated   tactics  to   avoid   trouble,   including   denial  in   the   face   of
obvious   evidence   and   dishonesty.  While   I  acknowledge   that  most   of   the
evidence   of  his  bad   judgment,   poor  decision   making,  and   rule-violating
behaviors  occurred   almost  a   decade   ago,  there  are  indications  that  he
omitted   information   on   his   SF   86   in   2018   (e.g.,   overlooking   his   present
marriage) and  that  he  provided  misleading  information   during  the  present
evaluation (e.g., denying  problems while in the Navy until confronted). This
suggests that he  continues  to  rely on  omissions,  counteraccusations, and
denials  to  resolve  problem  situations  (e.g.,  security clearance  investigation).
It  seems likely he  would  still  lie  to  cover his mistakes—a  serious concern if
he holds a security clearance  and/or works as an  aircraft mechanic.
CONCLUSIONS:  Based   on   available   data,   [Applicant’s]  mental   health
conditions  do   not  presently  impair   his  willingness  or  ability  to   safeguard
classified  information. Additionally, given  the  data  he  reported  is accurate,
the   risk of an  exacerbation   of   symptoms  seems to  be   low  at  this point   in
time.  However,  [he] has a  demonstrated  pattern of rule-violating  behavior,
poor  judgment,   and   dishonesty  that   could   reasonably   and   significantly
diminish   his  trustworthiness  and   judgment  in   a   national  security  context.
(GE 4 at 9-10)
SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c  allege  in  November  2012,  Applicant  was  involuntarily
committed  for mental-health  treatment,  and in  January 2013, Applicant  was  voluntarily
admitted  for  mental-health  treatment.  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  had  suicidal
ideations. (Tr. 69) He was an inpatient for about 14 days in November 2012, and he said
his treatment was outpatient in January 2013. (Tr. 68)
In   2012,  Applicant   was  diagnosed   with   ulcerative   colitis,  and   he   lost   about  35
pounds.  (Tr. 22)  He was unable  to  complete  physical activity,  and  his  former spouse  was
not   letting   him   see   his  children.  (Tr.   23)   He  became   extremely  depressed.   (Tr.  23)
Applicant’s father called Applicant’s supervisor and insisted that he receive help. (Tr. 24)
The  VA  is currently treating  him  for bipolar disorder. (Tr. 60) He sees a  VA  psychiatrist
once  every  three  months. (Tr. 60)  He  takes lithium twice  a  day.  (Tr. 61)  He did not  provide
any  VA   medical  treatment  records  to   corroborate   his  statements   about  consistently
receiving counseling and treatment.
I note that Applicant told Dr. E that he had a three-year-old daughter with Ms. G.
(Tr. 38) At his hearing, he said he misspoke. (Tr. 38) He said Ms. G had a daughter, and
he was not her father. (Tr. 39) He told Dr. E that he was accepting her as his daughter.
(Tr. 39)
Applicant  did   not  submit  any  documentation   contradicting   Dr.  E’s  opinions  and
conclusions. In  support  of his denial of SOR ¶¶  2.a, 2.b, and  2.c in his SOR response, he
asserted   he   supported   his  inpatient  treatment  when   he   asked   his  father  for  help,  and
therefore, it was not really involuntary. He said  Dr. E’s conclusions were probably based
on  the  allegations of others and  probably incorrect.  He is feeling  much  better now than
he felt in  2012.
Handling Protected Information  and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges Applicant improperly stored sensitive aircraft information on his
personal computer in about July 2010. He left the computer in the unsupervised custody
of a Peruvian national. On October 25, 2012, a special agent from the NCIS questioned
him, and he said he could not remember whether any information on his computer was
classified; however, he  confirmed  his computer had  sensitive aircraft  information on  it.
SOR ¶ 4.a cross-alleges the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a under Guideline E.
On August 25, 2012, Applicant made a sworn written statement to the NCIS which
states Ms. G had a friend from Miami. (GE 3 at 6) He said:
Her  friend   spoke   English,   German,  and   Spanish.   I  don’t   remember  her
name. I never took her to  the  base. I left a  personal [laptop  computer] in her
custody. On  that laptop  was aircraft maintenance  records . .  .  and  email
traffic pertaining  to  the  aircraft.  I   don’t think that the   maintenance  records
were classified  but I am not sure about some of the  emails. (GE 3  at 6)
At his hearing, Applicant said he gave his laptop computer to Ms. G, and he never
tried to get it back from her. (Tr. 61) There was one Navy maintenance status report and
one email on his computer; however, the documents were not sensitive or classified. (Tr.
58, 61-62, 70)
On November 7, 2012, the NCIS briefed a legal officer about Applicant’s alleged
actions relating to Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violation of an
order and Article 107, UCMJ for making a false statement. (GE 3 at 4) The NCIS report
indicates Applicant would be offered a captain’s mast. (Id.) The NCIS report also indicates
Applicant had been “Baker acted and spent 10 days in [a] mental health facility.” (Id. at 3)
Applicant said in January 2013, a summary court-martial (SCM) acquitted him of
violations  of  Article  92,  UCMJ  for  disobedience  of  an  order and  Article  107,  UCMJ  for
making a false statement. (Tr. 27-28, 62, 66) After his hearing, Applicant made a diligent
effort  to  locate  information  from  the  SCM;  however,  he  was  unable  to  obtain  any
documentation from his SCM. (Tr. 63; AE B) Section 15 Military History-- Discipline of his
May 5, 2018 SCA asks, “In the last 7years have you been subject to court-martial or other
disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), such as Article
15, [c]aptain’s mast, Article 135 Court of inquiry, etc.?” (GE 1 at 21) He answered, “No.”
(Id.) However, he did disclose on his SCA that he “went to a disciplinary review board”
based  on  issues  stemming  from  ulcerative  colitis  and  physical  fitness  training.  At  his
hearing, he did not know why he failed to list his SCM in his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 63-65) The
failure to disclose information about his SCM in his 2018 SCA and his OPM PSI were not
alleged in the SOR. (GE 1 at 21; GE 2 at 10)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his  personal travel to
Peru to his command while he was on active duty.
The NCIS investigation states Applicant, “disclosed he has been taking secret trips
to Peru to see his wife, [Ms. G], and that he had failed to report his close relationship to
a foreign national to his security manager.” (GE 3 at 4) In his sworn statement to NCIS
he said:
Since JUL 10, I have  been to Peru three  times. I went in DEC 10, MAR 11,
DEC 11, and most recently on  27 MAR 12 which is when I  married  her. On
all  of these  occasions I just  took leave  and  left  the  country. I did not  notify
my  command  or my   security  officer. I did not  get   a  threat  brief   nor was  I
debriefed  upon  my return. (GE 3 at 6)
Later in his sworn statement he said a special agent showed him a list of his seven
trips to Peru, Applicant said “That appears accurate. I did not tell my command about any
of these trips. They were personal trips, and I used my blue passport.” (GE 3 at 7)
Applicant said he  did  not inform  one  command  that  he  was  traveling  to  Peru. (Tr.
42) He said he  submitted  leave  papers to  his squadron  that he  was going  to  Peru, and  he
received  a  threat briefing  from  that command  before traveling  to  Peru. (Tr. 42-46) He said
he  told the  NCIS  he  did  not inform  his command  or security of his travel  to  Peru  on  those
four occasions. (Tr. 43; GE  3  at 6) He said he  made  this statement to  NCIS  because  he
“had  no  fight left [in] me,” and  he  was “beaten  down.” (Tr. 43-44, 46)  He did not provide
copies of the  leave  forms to  corroborate  his claims  that he  informed  his command  of his
trips to Peru before he  took them.
SOR ¶ 4.d alleges Applicant made a false statement to his command on October
25, 2012, when he said he was married to a Peruvian national over the telephone by the
America Embassy. In fact, he flew to Peru for the wedding. He admitted to the NCIS that
he made  a false  statement  to his command  about  getting married over the  telephone.
(GE 3 at 8) He said he “thought [he] would get in trouble if the command found out [he]
had gone to Peru without going through the proper procedures.” (Tr. 53; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 4.e alleges Applicant made a false statement to military investigators during
his  October  25,  2012  personal  subject  interview  (PSI).  He  falsely  said  he  was  being
extorted  by  a  Peruvian  national  (Ms.  G).  He  subsequently  admitted  this  was  false.  He
said he had married this individual, and he was voluntarily sending her money.
Applicant’s October 25, 2012 statement to NCIS investigators indicates he told two
senior  petty  officers  that  Ms.  G  threatened  him  by  telling  him  that  unless  he  provided
funds to her she would get a friend of hers from another part of the state where he lived
to come to his location and hurt him and his family. (GE 3 at 8) He told the NCIS that Ms.
G demanded $2,000 from him, and when he expressed reluctance to give her the money,
“she said that she had friends [living in the same state where he lived] and they could find
[him] which [he] understood to be a threat.” (Id. at 6) The NCIS statement states, “Also in
the above paragraphs I was not truthful with Agents . . . about being extorted by [Ms. G].”
(Id. at 8) Applicant admitted that his story about being extorted was a lie. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said a senior chief petty officer (SCPO) suggested to him
that he was being extorted by a woman in Peru, and Applicant said he told the SCPO this
was incorrect. (Tr. 49) The SCPO or possibly someone else evidently told the NCIS about
the extortion. (Tr. 49, 51-52) Applicant initially told the NCIS that Ms. G attempted to extort
money from him; however, he said his sworn statement to the NCIS about his making the
initial claim to the senior petty officers was incorrect. (Tr. 47-49)
SOR ¶¶ 4.f through 4.j alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his May 5, 2018
SCA in five different places:
¶   4.f—In  Section  17,  Marital/Relationship  Status,  Applicant  stated  his  current
marital status was “Divorced/Dissolved” (which referred to his first wife, not Ms. G) and
thereby deliberately failed to disclose he was married to a Peruvian national (Ms. G). In
Section 17 of his SCA, Applicant disclosed his first marriage and divorce. (GE 1 at 23) He
indicated his current marital status was “Divorced/Dissolved.” (Id.)
¶  4.g—In Section 19, Foreign Contacts, Applicant listed Ms. G as a former friend
who he last contacted in June 2016, and he failed to disclose his marriage and birth of
his  child.  (GE  1  at  26-27)  In  response  to  the  question  “Personal  (such  as  family  ties,
friendship, affection, common interests, etc.),” he said “Friendship.” (Id. at 27) Applicant
admitted  he  failed  to  disclose  his  marriage  to  Ms.  G;  however,  he  said  he  had  not
communicated with her for about two years at the time he completed his SCA. (Tr. 54)
The question did not specifically ask whether he had ever been married to Ms. G, and
this allegation is found for Applicant.
¶  4.h—Section 20A, Foreign Activities, asked Applicant, “Have you EVER provided
financial support for any foreign national?” (GE 1 at 28) Applicant answered, “No,” and he
failed  to  disclose  sending  about  $21,000  to  a  Peruvian  national  (Ms.  G)  between
September 2011 and October 2012.
Applicant admitted sending $600 to $700 monthly to Ms. G starting in September
2011. (Tr. 46) In 2012, he sent about $17,000 to Ms. G, and she gave some of it to family
and  friends.  (Tr.  47,  50;  GE  3  at  6)  Applicant  had  to  work  a  second  job  to  afford  his
payments to Ms. G. (Tr. 51) He said he did not know why he failed to disclose the funds
he sent to Ms. G on his SCA. (Tr. 55)
¶   4.i—Section  20C,  Foreign  Travel,  asked  Applicant  about  foreign  travel  in  the
previous seven years (the SCA is dated May 5, 2018). Applicant disclosed a single foreign
trip to Peru in May to June 2013, and he failed to disclose four additional foreign trips to
Peru in December 2011, and March 2012. (GE 1 at 30) At his hearing, he admitted he
traveled to Peru during December 2011, and March 2012, and he said he should have
disclosed the trips. (Tr. 42, 55) He said he did not remember why he failed to disclose the
trips two to Peru on his SCA. (Tr. 56-57)
¶   4.j—Section  21,  Psychological  and  Emotional  Health  –  Hospitalized,  asked
“Have you EVER been hospitalized for a mental health condition?” (GE 1 at 32) Applicant
answered,  “No.”  (Id.)  He  admitted  that  he  failed  to  disclose  the  hospitalization  in
November  2012  for  his  mental  health  condition.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  did  not
remember why he did not disclose his hospitalizations for psychological and emotional
health on his SCA. (Tr. 56)
SOR ¶  4.k alleges Applicant falsified material facts during his July 16, 2018 OPM
PSI, and SOR ¶¶ 4.l through 4.o allege he falsified material facts during his October 12,
2018 OPM PSI in four different ways:
¶  4.k states  Applicant said he  had  no  contact with  Ms. G  since  “shortly after”  his
May 2013  trip  to  Peru.  Applicant  told  the  OPM  investigator that  he  broke  up  with  Ms.  G
shortly after May  2013 and  he  had not  had any contact with  her since  this  time. (GE  2  at
6) In  the  follow-up OPM  PSI  on  October 12, 2018, he  said  he  had  “not had  any contact
with her since 6/2016.” (GE  2  at 11)
¶ 4.l states Applicant denied that he failed to report his personal travel to  Peru, as
required,  and  thereby  deliberately failed  to  disclose  that  information  in  SOR ¶¶  4.c  and
4.d.  His OPM  PSI states that he  did not bring  his passport to  the  interview. (GE 2  at 10)
The OPM  PSI states:
Subject was confronted with failing to report leaving the country and going
to  Peru  to  visit  a  Peruvian  woman  to  his  security  manager  (Discrepant).
Subject denies this failure and stated he listed Peru, the only trip that he
had  was  in  2010  and  2011  for  short  trips  with  the  military  on  official
government business. (GE 2 at 10)
At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  should  have  reported  the  additional  trips  to  Peru;
however, he was only thinking about the trip in January 2013. (Tr. 55) He also said he did
not remember why he failed to disclose the trips to Peru. (Tr. 56-57)
¶   4.m   states  Applicant  repeatedly  denied   his  March  2012   marriage   to   Ms.  G.
Applicant’s July 16, 2018 OPM  PSI states:
Subject was confronted with 9/2011 sending money to a Peruvian associate
who  he  married  in  3/2012  in  the  amount  $600-$700  and  after  they  were
married, he increased the amount to $2,000-$3,000. Subject stated he did
send listed foreign contact [Ms. G] money to help her family. But never felt
this was reason to report because he looked at it as helping a friend and not
supporting  a  foreign  national.  He  did  not  know  there  was  an  issue  with
helping a friend who was a foreign national. He continued to deny that he
was ever married to her or any foreign national.
At his hearing, he admitted that he failed to disclose his marriage to Ms. G. to the
OPM investigator during his PSI. (Tr. 54) He said he could not remember what he was
thinking at the time he made that statement to the investigator. (Tr. 58)
¶  4.n  states  Applicant  denied  having  ever been  involuntarily committed  to  a  mental-
health  facility.  The  OPM  PSI indicates he  volunteered  for mental health  treatment,  and  he
denied  that he  received  involuntary treatment  or that he  was “Baker acted.” (GE 2  at 11)
He said he  was diagnosed  with  bipolar disorder since  September 2011, and  he  was seen
at  the   VA   hospital.  (Id.  at  14)  He  was  not  prescribed   any  medication   and   he   did  not
regularly see a  provider or counselor. (Id.)
¶   4.o  states  Applicant  denied  having  ever  “been  involved  in,  suspected  of,  or
accused of the improper handling or compromise of sensitive, classified, or proprietary
information.” The OPM PSI indicates he said:
[He]  has  never  provided   anyone   with   anything   which   was  not  entirely  in
keeping   with   regulations.  [He]   has  not   had   any  occasions   in  which  his
actions   could   have   possibly  resulted   in   a   compromise   of   his  duties  or  a
compromise  of  sensitive   or  classified   information.  [He]  has  never  been
involved   in,   suspected   of,  or  accused   of   the   improper  handling   or
compromise   of  sensitive,  classified,   or  proprietary  information.  (GE   12   at
13)
Applicant’s father is a retired Air Force colonel who completed 30 years of service.
(Tr. 23) His father’s statement indicates Applicant was diagnosed with leukemia when he
was  three years old  and  received  chemotherapy  on multiple occasions  for  32 months.
(AE A) When Applicant was 19 years old, he attempted to join the Air Force; however, he
was  unable  to enlist  in  the Air Force  because  of  his previous medical  history. (Id.) He
successfully enlisted in the Navy. He served in the Navy for 20 years, and on April 30,
2013, he honorably retired after being acquitted at a SCM in January 2013.
His father said that  Applicant “is currently in  a  good  mental  place. Clearly, the  meds
are working  .  .  . [I]n mid-2018, he  quickly improved from his  mental position, because  he
was being  treated  by the  VA. And  during  that  treatment,  he  really rapidly improved.” (Tr.
25)  He concluded  Applicant’s mistakes in his  statement to  the  NCIS  occurred  because
“He  was both  mentally  and  physically, absolutely wiped  out.  And, when  you’re  in those
situations, you’re not thinking clearly. And  he was not thinking clearly. And, based on Dr.
[E’s] comments,  it’s clear to  me  that he  believes [Applicant]  has  moved  beyond  that state
of  mind.”  (Tr.  31)  His  mental  health   has   dramatically   improved   since   the   time   he   was
receiving  inpatient mental-health  treatment. (Tr. 33) His father said,  “he’s  completely in a
different state  of mind than  he was at that point in time.” (Tr. 33)
Applicant received the following Navy awards: Navy Achievement Medal (6); Joint
Meritorious Unit Award (2); Good Conduct Medal (6); National Defense Service Medal
(2); Navy “E” Ribbon; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (2); Global War on Terrorism
Service  Medal;  Global  War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary  Medal;  Armed  Forces  Service
Medal;  Sea  Service  Deployment  Ribbon  (6);  Navy  Recruiting  Ribbon;  United  Nations
Medal; Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon; and EAWS Insignia. (SOR response, DD Form 214)
",True
"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  since  September  2018.  He  received  an  associate  degree  from  a  technical
institute in July 2008. He has never married and has no children.
Applicant worked in non-federal jobs after receiving his associate degree until he
was hired by a federal contractor in July 2009. He received a security clearance in June
2009.  From  August  2009  to  August  2012,  he  was  assigned  to  duties  as  a  contractor
employee  with  U.S.  Marines  in  an  overseas  location.  While  assigned  to  duty  with  the
Marines, he was reprimanded by his civilian employer for his conduct on one occasion.
The  record  does  not  reflect  the  conduct  for  which  he  was  reprimanded.  After  his
employer’s contract ended in August 2012, he worked for other federal contractors. At the
time he submitted his SCA, he had been working for a federal contractor since October
2017. He was terminated from this employment in August 2018 for reasons set out in the
SOR, and he was hired by his current employer shortly thereafter.
Applicant’s  job  description  while  working  for  his  former  employer  as  the  senior
systems  administrator  made  him  responsible  for  “ensuring  the  reliable  operation  of  IT
systems.” His specific duties and responsibilities included providing server management
of  classified  and  unclassified  networks;  providing  configuration,  support,  maintenance,
and  troubleshooting  of  systems,  servers,  and  desktops;  and  establishing  scripts  to
automate the team’s infrastructure task, patching, and other operations duties. (GX- 3 at
20)
Applicant testified that his first year with his former employer went well, but after
the  leadership  changed,  several  employees  were  replaced  with  outsiders  who  had
worked  for  the  new  leadership.  Because  he  did  not  believe  that  the  new  leadership
understood the requirements of his job, he began searching for a new job. He accepted
an offer from his current employer while still working for his former employer. (Tr. 15-16)
Applicant  testified  that  on  August  20,  2018,  while  he  was  still  employed  by  his
former employer, he was verbally informed by his immediate supervisor that he was being
terminated because of his “hostile behavior” toward a senior executive of the company at
a meeting two days earlier, by removing his glasses and rubbing his forehead while the
senior executive was speaking. Applicant testified that he was upset at being terminated
and asked his supervisor what the real reason was for his termination.  (Tr. 22) On the
same day, he sent an email to his supervisor denying that he acted aggressively at the
meeting with the senior executive. (AX F at 4)
On  August  23,  2018,  Applicant’s  supervisor  sent  him  an  email  alleging  eight
concerns that had arisen since April 2018 and were the basis for his termination. Applicant
testified that he did not receive this email, which was sent to his father’s email address.
(GX  3  at  2;  Tr.  24)  Five  concerns  were  incorporated  into  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  alleging
concerns  under  Guideline  K.  SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleged  the  same  five  concerns  under
Guideline M. The eight concerns in the former employer’s August 2018 email were copied
verbatim into SOR ¶ 3.a, alleging personal conduct under Guideline E.
The August 2018 email did not describe the evidence on which the eight concerns
were based. There is no evidence that the concerns were investigated before the email
was sent to Applicant. The concerns were described in general terms in the email, and
the SOR allegations incorporating them did not meet the specificity required by Directive
¶ E3.1.3 (SOR shall be a detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits).
The evidence pertaining to the allegations in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: Security  threats (attempting to  access  systems  without  clearance
(Concern  #1).  Applicant  denied  this  allegation.  The  record  contains  no  evidence  of
attempts by Applicant to access systems without a proper clearance.
SOR  ¶   1.b:   Performing  systems   scans   not   within  requested  tasks   or  job
duties  (Concern #4). Applicant denied this allegation. The record contains no evidence
of instances when Applicant performed systems scans that were not within his assigned
duties.
SOR  ¶   1.c:  Attempting  to   secure   an  administrator  account   for  network
devices  without  a  top secret clearance  (Concern #5).  Applicant testified that he had
no memory of requesting an administrator account for himself. He believed that he had
all the access he needed to perform his job. (Tr. 31) In response to DOHA interrogatories,
he stated that the only times he submitted requests for new administrative accounts was
for new administrators joining the program. These requests were part of his duties as a
senior administrator. (GX 3 at 3, 5)
SOR ¶  1.d: Bringing a  personal  CD-ROM  into the  secure  workplace  (Concern
#6). Applicant admitted this allegation. He testified that he had a personal CD-ROM in his
gym bag, and he had forgotten that it was in his gym bag when he came to work. As soon
as he discovered it, he turned it in to his supervisor, because he knew that bringing it into
the workplace was a violation of his employer’s rules. (Tr. 28-29)
SOR ¶  1.e:  Returning to  the  secure  office  environment  after hours  for a  not
verifiable   or   reasonable   purpose   (Concern  #3).   Applicant  admitted  returning  to  the
office after hours for non-work purposes. He testified that there were occasions when he
missed  his  bus  during  cold  weather,  and  he  returned  to  the  office  to  wait  for  other
transportation. There were other team members still working while he was in the secure
area. There is no evidence that he engaged in any suspicious activity while in the office.
He testified that he was never told that he was forbidden to be in the office outside of his
prescribed work hours. (Tr. 34)
SOR ¶  2.a: Cross-alleges  SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.e  under  Guideline  M. The evidence is
the same as described above for SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e.
SOR ¶  2.b: Termination from employment  due to  concerns  in SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.e.
The  evidence  establishes  that  Applicant  was  terminated  for the  reasons  set  out  in  the
SOR. However, only SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e were supported by evidence in the record.
SOR ¶  3.a: Terminated from employment  for violations  alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.a-
1.e,  plus   Concern  #2   (Inability  to   mask   emotions  to   the   point   of   disrupting
meetings), Concern #7  (Repeated attire  and appearance  issues), and  Concern  #8
(Aggressive behavior during a customer/co-worker meeting).
The  record  contains  no  evidence  that  Applicant  disrupted  meetings.  When
Applicant was questioned by a security investigator about disruptive behavior at work, he
disclosed one occasion involving an exchange of words with a coworker about how to do
a job. He considered it to be no more than a disagreement. (GX 3 at 13) The only evidence
of  “aggressive  behavior”  was  the  accusation  of  his  supervisor  that  he  engaged  in
aggressive  behavior  by  removing  his  glasses  and  rubbing  his  head  while  a  senior
executive  was  speaking  at  a  meeting.  (Tr.  22)  There  is  no  evidence  of  the  attire  and
appearance  requirements  for  his  job  and  no  evidence  that  he  was  warned  about
inappropriate  attire.  To  the  contrary, a  co-worker submitted a  statement  that  Applicant
always wore appropriate attire and that he wore a shirt and tie every day even though
business casual was the norm. (AX A)
Two  senior  systems  engineers  employed  by  Applicant’s  former  employer
submitted statements rebutting the eight concerns about Applicant. One of them stated
that if he had any doubts about Applicant’s trustworthiness and professional behavior, he
would not have submitted his statement of support. (AX A; AX B)
Applicant testified that his overseas service with the Marine Corps was stressful.
In addition, his partner passed away in 2013. He believed that he was diagnosed  by a
psychiatrist  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.  He  is  currently  taking  medication  for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. (Tr. 35-38)
Applicant is highly regarded by his current employer. His senior program manager
and  program  director  each  submitted  letters  commenting  on  his  proficiency,  rigorous
adherence  to  information  security,  outstanding  interpersonal  skills,  and  ability  to  work
within a team. (AX C; AX D)

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c and 1.e. He denied ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f,
1.h, and 1.i, with explanations. He did not specifically admit or deny SOR ¶¶ 1.g or 2.a.
As such, I will  treat  Applicant’s  lack of response to SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 2.a as a denial of
those allegations. His SOR admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  72  years  old,  married  and  has  two  adult  children.  He  obtained  his
bachelor’s  degree  in 1977.  He  started  with the  predecessor of his current  employer in
1979  and  has  continuously  remained  in  a  full-time  position  with  the  company  or  its
successor  since  then.  As  of  his  September  2021  SCA  submission,  he  was  a  senior
systems engineer. (GX 3, 5-6)
Employment  records  reflect  that,  from  2011  through  2020,  Applicant  committed
multiple  security  violations  that  required  reporting  to  the  Government  by  his  employer
under 32 CFR Part 117.8 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual
(NISPOM). The first incident occurred in March 2011. (SOR ¶ 1.i) A company Individual
Culpability  Report  (ICR)  stated  that  company  proprietary  and  competition-sensitive
documents  were  left  unsecured  on  Applicant’s  desk.  Further  inspection  of  Applicant’s
workspace  yielded  multiple  unsecured  proprietary  documents.  A  security  citation  was
issued to Applicant. (GX 4)
In   August  2014   and   again  in  November  2014,  company  proprietary  documents
were   discovered   unsecured   in  and   around   Applicant’s  desk  and   workspace.  (SOR  ¶¶
1.g   and   1.h)  In   both   instances,  an   ICR  was  drafted   and   Applicant  received   security
citations. (GX 4)
In  September  2016,  during  a  random  building  sweep,  multiple  company
proprietary and export-controlled documents were discovered unsecured on Applicant’s
desk. (SOR ¶ 1.f) An ICR was drafted and Applicant received another security citation.
(GX 4)
In two separate incidents in April 2018, Applicant’s employer discovered that he
left  company  proprietary  and  export-controlled  documents  and  diagrams  unsecured  in
his workspace. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) After the first incident, Applicant was specifically
advised  that  “documents  must  be  placed  in  a  locked  cabinet  and  the  keys  not
accessible.” After the second incident two weeks later, security personal requested  that
supervisors meet with Applicant to review company procedures regarding the protection
of information. ICRs were issued in both instances. (GX 4)
In  August  2018,  during  another  random  building  sweep,  company  proprietary
documents were discovered unattended and unsecured in Applicant’s workspace. (SOR
¶  1.c) An ICR was drafted and  he  received another security  citation. It was noted that
this was his third violation that year and security personal again advised supervisors to
meet with him and take corrective measures. (GX 4)
During  “routine  monitoring  of  employee  asset  usage,”  company  investigators
observed  that,  from April through June 2020,  Applicant  sent four emails from  his work
email  account  to  his  personal  email  account  that  contained  documents  marked  as
company  proprietary.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  When  confronted,  Applicant  stated  that  he  sent  the
documents to his personal email so that he could  work on  them  at  home  since  “it  was
an inconvenience to pack up all his work assets to take home.” An ICR was drafted and
Applicant  confirmed  that  he  deleted  the  relevant  files  from  his  personal  email  and
computer. He was advised of company policies regarding the use of personal email and
received verbal counseling from his supervisor. (GX 4)
Despite  the  counseling,  in  August  2020,  Applicant  sent  another  document
marked as proprietary and export controlled from his work email to his personal email.
When confronted, Applicant stated that he sent the document to his personal email as a
template  for  another  work  project  and  believed  the  document  did  not  contain  any
proprietary  information.  However,  his  supervisor  confirmed  that  the  documents  did
contain proprietary information  and  that there was no  “legitimate business purpose” for
Applicant  to  have  sent  company  “intellectual  property”  to  his  personal  email.  Another
ICR was drafted. This was noted as Applicant’s second “data infiltration incident” within
the last 12 months and he was issued a written warning. (GX 4)
None of the reports reflect that there was ever a loss or compromise of classified
information  during  any  of  these  incidents  and  Applicant’s  supervisor  noted  that
Applicant’s  actions  were  not  “nefarious.”  When  requested  by  his employer, he  deleted
the relevant documents from his personal email and home computer. (GX 4)
In his September 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he  was “written  up” by his
employer  in  April  2020  because  he  sent  a  document  marked  “company  proprietary”
from  his  work  email  to  his  personal  email.  He  explained  that  everyone  was  remote
working  during  the  COVID  pandemic  and he  was  trying to  complete  an  assignment  to
maintain the program schedule. Applicant blamed the “recent total encryption of all files”
for  making  it  “impossible”  to  work  on  any  computer  outside  of  the  network.  Applicant
emphasized that he “CREATED” the document at issue and that “there was NOTHING
classified” in it. (Emphasis in original) He did not detail any of the other incidents in his
SCA. (GX 3)
During  his  December  2021  background  interview  with  a  DOD  investigator,
Applicant  again  disclosed  that  he  had  received  a  written  warning  in  April  2020.  He
described  sending  a  document  that  he  was  drafting  from  his  work  computer  to  his
personal  email  to  continue  working  on  the  document.  The  investigator  noted  that
Applicant “considered the document to be unclassified”  and, at the time,  was unaware
that he was not allowed to send the document to his personal computer. He described
later  meeting  with  his  supervisor  about  the  incident  and  being  required  to  review
company  policy  on  handling  proprietary  information.  Afterwards,  he  claimed  to
understand the company policy and admitted his mistake. (GX 5)
Also  during  his  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  been
employed with the company for over 40 years and that this was the “first incident of this
nature that he  had  been  involved  in.” He did not detail the other incidents or ICRs that
he had received. (GX 5)
In his Answer, Applicant  stated  that  he  did not  “completely admit fault nor deny
culpability” regarding  the  incidents from  2011  through  2018. He stated  that ""[company]
proprietary”  was  the  “de  facto”  label  for  everything  that  came  off  the  printer or  that  he
worked  with  on  the  computer.  He  further  stated  that  he  was  “always  under  the
assumption”  that  he  worked  in  a  “safe  and  secure  environment”  and  that  no  one  was
“allowed  to  graze  through  the  offices  and  laboratories  (without  challenge)  to  examine
and  take  what  they  wish.”  He  also  questioned  company  policy  as  he  stated  it  was
“peculiar” that his company defined “properly secure” as the use of “simple office locks.”
(Answer)
With regard to the incidents from April through August 2020, Applicant  admitted
the  relevant  allegations,  but  only  discussed  the  incidents  as  a  single  event.  He  stated
that, “as time became short,” he sent documents to his personal email so that he could
complete the task on time.  He further stated that once he was notified of the error, he
deleted the material from his home computer that day. (Answer)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide  any  further
information to explain or mitigate his actions.

"Applicant  is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He  has worked for
his current employer since July 2020. He  seeks to retain a security clearance, which  he
has held  with  some  breaks since about  1991.  He  earned a bachelor’s degree  in   1982
and  a master’s degree  in  2003.  He is married  with  two children.  (Transcript (Tr.) at  34-
35, 37-40; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  traffic  offenses  and   workplace  problems,   including  a
security violation and  multiple terminations. Between 2006  and  February 2019, he was
cited  for   at  least  14  moving  violations  in   two  states.   Eleven  of  the  citations  were  for
speeding.  His  driving   privileges   were  suspended   for   90  days  in   2011.   (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 5, 6)
In  September  2013,  Applicant  took  a  classified  document  home  without
authorization  from  one  site  and  transported  it  to  another  classified  site  the  next  day
(SOR  ¶  1.a).  The  security  violation  report  indicated  the  document  was  marked
“Secret/NOFORN.”  Applicant did not report the incident until November 2013 when he
was  discussing the  document  with  the  person who created  the  document.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B) During the investigation of the incident, he stated:
Since I had  no office  space  at [Site A] and  was still  getting settled in  a new
office  at  [Site B]  with no [redacted] computer assigned to  me  yet. I took the
document  in  my  locked  briefcase   home  overnight.   I  knew   this  was  not
proper protocol, but I felt the risk was mitigated since it was locked  in  my
briefcase.  (GE 3)
Applicant  stated  that  the  document  was  about  ten   pages  long,  and   only  one   or
two   pages   were  classified.  He   justified  his   actions  by  stating  that  the   document  was
improperly marked, without a classified  cover sheet, and that the information should not
have  been classified because  it was in  the public domain and readily available through
the Internet. He  also stated that his locked briefcase was the functional  equivalent of a
courier bag.  He  has never had  a  courier card to transport classified information, and  he
somewhat  reluctantly  admitted   that  he  knew   the  document  was   classified.  He   was
terminated from  his employment in  November 2013 because of the incident  (SOR ¶ 2.f).
(Tr. at 12-15, 23-33, 41-59, 76-79; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE B, C)
As  mitigation  for  the   incident,  Applicant   asserted  that  there   were  inadequate
instructions  for   his  team  on  how  to  deal  with  courier   processes;  the  document  was
locked in  his briefcase in  his kitchen overnight,  so there was no compromise  of data; it
has  been  seven  years  since  the   incident,  with  no  additional  incidents;   and   it   does  not
constitute  a  pattern,   therefore  the  incident  was  “inadvertent.”   When  pressed,  he
admitted his actions were not “inadvertent.” He  has received additional security training,
most  recently in  July 2020.  (Tr. at 37-38,  42-43, 47-48, 77-79; Applicant’s response to
SOR; AE B, C)
Applicant has a problematic employment history with numerous employers. The
SOR alleges that Applicant received an incident warning letter from an employer for an
incident  in  July  2015,  and  that  he  was  terminated  from  eight  jobs  between  2004  and
2018.  Most,  if  not  all,  of  the  information  about  Applicant’s  employment  history  came
from  him  in  his  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86),  during  his
background interview,  in response to interrogatories, in his SOR response, and during
his testimony.
Applicant was terminated from a job in July 2004 for unsatisfactory performance
(SOR ¶ 2.a). He wrote that he “was terminated after [his] manager missed an important
meeting  because  he  had  something  more  important  to  do  at  his  home.”  Applicant
explained that his manager could not attend a meeting and the customer was unhappy
with how Applicant handled the meeting. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant was terminated from another job in March 2005 for not complying with
his manager’s directions (SOR ¶ 2.b). He  wrote that he “was laid off  from  this position
for doing too much work.” He stated that he took an action at the request of a customer
after  his  manager  told  him  not  to  take  that  type  of  action.  Applicant  stated  that  he
thought  it  was  acceptable  because  it  was  at  the  customer’s  request.  (Tr.  at  73-74;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant  lost  a job in July 2008  (SOR  ¶ 2.c).  The reason for  the termination  is
not in the record. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant was terminated from a job in November 2010 for failing to complete a
customer-requested  task  (SOR  ¶  2.d).  He  wrote  that  he  “was  framed  by  an  impatient
requestor who could not get his change processed fast enough.” (Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant’s employment was terminated in about December 2012 for sending an
e-mail to a client that was critical of the client. (SOR ¶ 2.e). He wrote that his employer
“let  [him]  go  for  a  silly  email  that  the  customer  took  offense  to  about  spelling  and
grammar.”  Applicant  stated  that  the  client’s  e-mail  was  not  well  written  and  did  not
convey  the  message  the  client  wanted  to  convey.  Applicant’s  reply  e-mail  pointed  out
that  the  client’s  e-mail  was  hard  to  understand  and  poorly  worded.  (Tr.  at  69-73;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant  received  an  incident  warning  letter  from  an  employer  in  about  July
2015 for raising his voice and chastising co-workers for not displaying their badges, and
for  raising  his  voice  and  behaving  aggressively  toward  a  co-worker  (SOR  ¶  2.g).  He
stated that he did not intentionally behave aggressively toward the co-worker (Tr. at 70)
Applicant was terminated from his job with the above employer in about February
2016  for  failing  to  comply  with  directions  (SOR  ¶  2.h).  He  wrote  that  he  was
“[t]erminated  for  doing  too  much  work  and  doing  unneeded  work  by  helping  [another
employee] learn a new skill.” (Tr. at 69-70; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant’s  employment  was  terminated  in  October  2016  after  his  security
clearance  was  unable  to  be  processed  because  of  the  2013  security  incident  (SOR  ¶
2.i). (Tr. at 35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant  was  terminated  from  a  job  in  about  February  2018  for  lack  of
professionalism (SOR ¶ 2.j). He stated that he was working at a federal building, and he
had  to  be  escorted  everywhere  because  he  did  not  have  a  Common  Access  Card
(CAC). He was observed walking to the front of the building without an escort. He stated
that he was leaving the building, and he was told he did not require an escort when he
was leaving. (Tr. at 65-68; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2).
Applicant’s  father  testified  that  Applicant  is  of  the  highest  character  with  strong
morals,  and  he  is  active  in  his  church.  Applicant  submitted  documents  attesting  to  his
excellent  job  performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  reliability,  attention  to  detail,
commitment, adaptability, professionalism, responsibility, and dedication. (Tr. at 81-84;
