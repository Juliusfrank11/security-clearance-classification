"Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the Air
National  Guard  from  1996  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2002.  He  graduated
from law school in 2008. He is married with children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 57, 159; GE 1-
3; AE 9)
Applicant  worked  in  software  development  before  he  went  to  law  school.  He
practiced law for a period, but then went back to software development. He worked for a
defense  contractor  from  2009  to  2017,  primarily  as  a  software  developer  and  system
administrator at a DOD agency. (Tr. at 57-60, 87; GE 1-3)
In August 2017, the DOD agency notified the Inspector General (IG) that during
routine  monitoring  of  Internet  usage  and  network  traffic,  they  detected  that  Applicant
used a government information technology (IT) system to view illicit material containing
sexual content, which was against the agency’s IT policy. The report indicated:



In January 2017, Applicant searched Google for “girl rubbing herself.” The search
contained nude images and sexual content.
In  June  2017,  Applicant  searched  Google  for  “rubbing  her  [vulgar  term  for
vagina].” The search contained nude images and sexual content.
In June 2017, Applicant searched Google for “female oral.” Applicant then viewed
several pages of nude images of men and women engaged in sexual acts. (GE
4)
The agency further reported that since 2012, Applicant had been involved in 19
other cases of unauthorized software downloads. The software included graphics, audio
and  music  editing  software,  bar  examination  preparation  software,  and  text  editing
software.  The  agency  noted  that  Applicant  was  sent  a  user  account-violation  warning
letter on a specific date in April 2016. (GE 4, 5)
In  August  2017,  Applicant’s  access  to  the  DOD  agency’s  network  was
suspended, and he was escorted off the premises. He asserted that he was not told the
reason. He wrote an e-mail with a copy to the IG. He thought the IG might already have
an  open  investigation,  and  he  was  “concerned  that  [he]  was  being  inappropriately
removed”  from  the  contract.  He  wrote:  “If  the  reason  that  I’m  being  removed  for  is
working on [an]other project for another company, during contract hours, I would like to
explain.”  He  indicated  that  during  lulls  in  work  or  when  he  needed  a  break,  he  would
practice programming on his personal websites. (Tr. at 111-117; GE 4, 6)
The IG obtained a report of Applicant’s unclassified Internet usage. From March
2017 through August 2017, Applicant visited his personal websites 1,015 times. The IG
contacted  an  unidentified  individual,  who  stated  that  Applicant’s  use  of  his  personal
websites for duty-related purposes was not in compliance with the contract statement of
work (SOW). (GE 6)
Applicant was interviewed over the telephone by an IG investigator in December
2017.  He  stated  that  he  used  his  personal  websites  to  practice  programming  and
develop solutions for site problems at the DOD agency. He estimated that from March
2017  to  August  2017,  he  visited  his  personal  websites  about  three  to  four  times  per
week, for up to two hours per day. The IG estimated that equated to between 150 and
200  hours  at  an  hourly  rate  of  $153,  or  between  $23,071  and  $30,762.  The  IG
concluded that Applicant committed contractor cost mischarging (labor hours) when he
submitted  fraudulent  timesheets  that  included  150  to  200  hours  that  he  spent  working
on tasks not specified in the contract SOW. The U.S. Government apparently recouped
an amount in the above range from a defense contractor. (Tr. at 113-121, 148-151; GE
6)
Applicant  denied  some  of  the  conduct  and  explained  the  rest.  He  admitted  that
he downloaded software, but he stated that it was  primarily for his job. He was a data
transfer officer (DTO) who would download items for others. He admitted downloading a
few  programs  that  were  not  for  his  job,  such  as  a  Sudoku  solver  and  an  audio
manipulation program that he used to make old songs sound better. He does not recall
downloading  the  bar  examination  preparation  software,  but  he  surmises  that  he  likely
did.  He  stated  that  employees  were  permitted  incidental  non-official  use  of  their
computers,  and  he  did  not  realize  that  he  was  unauthorized  to  download  any  of  the
software. He denied ever receiving a warning letter. He stated that the only thing he was
told was that the Sudoku solver was unauthorized, and it was deleted from his system.
(Tr. at 59-70, 85-86, 123-127, 153-155; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant denied intentionally submitting fraudulent timesheets. He asserted that
his use of his websites was to hone his skills as a software developer or to benefit the
DOD  agency.  Additionally,  incidental  non-official  use  of  the  computer  was  permitted.
(Tr. at 59-60, 86-101, 141-153, 156-159; AE 5-7)
Applicant admitted that he conducted the Google searches on the government IT
system,  which  revealed  inappropriate  material,  but  he  denied  that  he  viewed  sexually
explicit material. Applicant was involved in an online affair with a woman he had  never
met in person. The affair included graphic chats and exchanges from his phone, which
involved  sexually  explicit  materials  and  “phone  sex.”  He  wanted  to  send  her  flirtatious
and  suggestive  material with  “non-explicit  but  sexual images” using  the  GIF  (Graphics
Interchange Format - short animated or moving pictures) format over the government IT
system. He knew the system had SafeSearch, which would screen out most, but not all,
graphic materials. He admitted that even with SafeSearch on, he “came across explicit
images a few times. [He] did not download these and browsed away quickly, or closed
the  browser.”  He  also  admitted  that  he  “had  several  inappropriate  text  conversations”
with the woman from a government computer. (Tr. at 71-77, 82-84, 102-106, 128-141,
155-156; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE 3, 4, 15)
Applicant  described  one  of  the  GIFs  he  sent  as  what  appeared  to  be  a  man
performing  oral  sex  on  a  woman.  Another  was  of  a  woman  with  her  hand  inside  her
underwear  apparently  masturbating.  He  asserted  that  there  was  no  visible  nudity  or
genitalia in any of the GIFs. (Tr. at 71-72, 83-84, 133-134; GE 2, 3; AE 3)
Applicant stated that his affair with the woman ended in August 2017, a few days
before he was removed from the contract. He asserted that he was never told why he
was  removed  from  the  contract.  He  thought  the  affair  itself,  but  not  necessarily  the
inappropriate searches, might have been discovered. He stated that he did not think the
inappropriate  searches  and  images  were  an  issue  until  he  thought  it  through  about  a
week or two after he was removed from the contract. He told his wife of the online affair
in August 2017. He also sought advice and counseling through his church. (Tr. at 78-80,
101, 106-113; AE 4, 9, 14)
Applicant thought the affair could have been “a point of blackmail.” He indicated
that he “drafted a letter to self-report in August of 2017 but was advised to not report by
a  trusted  advisor.”  He  discussed  the  information  during  his  background  interview  in
March  2018.  He  reported  the  information  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  in  April
2018. In that report, he indicated the incidents happened “[d]uring a rough patch in [his]
marriage in May-July 2017.” When asked at hearing how that accounted for his search
in January 2017, he stated that  he and the woman were friends before January 2017,
and the flirtatious behavior, but not the full online affair, started in January 2017.  (Tr. at
78, 107-111, 131-132; AE 4, 14)
Applicant  apologized  for  his  inappropriate  conduct.  His  actions  cost  him  his  job
and almost his marriage. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson,
and that the conduct will not be repeated. (Tr. at 81-82, 121-122, 137)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community,  and  he  is  active  in  his  church.  He
submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  moral  character  and  excellent  job
performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  work  ethic,  honesty,  trustworthiness,  judgment,
loyalty,  strength,  determination,  dependability,  integrity,  and  willingness  and  ability  to
protect  classified  information.  He  is  recommended  for  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  at  18-
35, 51-54; AE 8-13)

"Applicant is a 33-year-old single man. He earned an associate’s degree in 2009, and
a bachelor’s degree in 2013. (Tr. 28) For the past 12 years, he has been working in the
information technology field. (Tr. 12, 53) Most recently, since 2018, he has been working
for a defense contractor as an information technology specialist. (Tr. 48) He currently holds
public trust access to sensitive information. (Tr. 66)
Applicant is a native of Cameroon. He has been a naturalized citizen of the United
States since 2011.  (Tr. 37) He immigrated to the United States when he was 11 years old
and spent the remainder of his childhood living with his uncle, a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 32, 43) In
addition to raising Applicant after he immigrated to the United States, his uncle helped
finance his education. (Tr. 43) When Applicant first moved to the United States, it was very
expensive to make long-distance calls to Cameroon. (Tr. 39) Consequently, Applicant’s
parents seldom talked to him. Similarly, they did not often travel to the United States to visit
him. Applicant did not hear from his parents or see them for nine years after he relocated.
(Tr. 39) Ultimately, although Applicant’s relationship with his parents is cordial, he has more
of a parental relationship with his uncle than his parents. (Tr. 43)
Currently, Applicant’s parents have permanent U.S. residence status. (Tr. 43) They
moved here in 2017.  Later, Applicant’s mother returned to Cameroon. She owns a store
that sells baby products. (Tr. 40) Typically, Applicant talks to his mother twice per month.
Since the pandemic, he has been talking to her daily. (Tr. 43) Applicant’s parents remain
married. Applicant’s mother travels to the United States approximately two to three times
per year to visit Applicant and his father. (Answer to Amendment to the SOR, at 2; Tr. 41)
Applicant last travelled to Cameroon to visit his mother in 2013. (GE 1 at 38)
When Applicant’s father lived in Cameroon, he owned a cleaning business. (Tr. 39)
He suffered a massive, debilitating stroke in 2017. (Tr. 40) Partially paralyzed and non-
verbal, it is unlikely that he will return to Cameroon.
Applicant has approximately $27,000 invested in retirement accounts. (Tr. 35) He
owns no assets in Cameroon. (Tr. 36)
The United States has had diplomatic relations with Cameroon since Cameroon’s
independence in 1960. (AN I at 1) Cameroon “plays a key role in regional stability and [is]
the strongest regional partner in countering terrorism” in the region. (AN I at 1) Cameroon
and the United States are closely engaged in issues that address democracy, governance,
regional security, environmental protection, health, and economic development. (AN I at 2)
Cameroon has struggled to contain terrorism, particularly in its rural, remote region in the
north, where Boko Haram is active, borders are porous, and there is a political insurgency.
(AN II at 1) Applicant’s mother does not live near this area.
In July 2014, Applicant began a job as a help desk administrator. His duties included
maintaining the server and monitoring the network for malware. (GE 2 at 7) Applicant’s
career goal was to earn a promotion to work on cyber-security projects. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 49)
While  working  at  this  job,  Applicant  was  working  towards  earning  a  cyber-security
certification.
On  December  19,  2014,  Applicant’s  employer  identified  suspicious  activity  on
Applicant’s computers. Specifically, an analysis of one of Applicant’s computers indicated
that he attempted to initiate a peer-to-peer connection with a remote host outside of his
employer’s network. This type of activity was prohibited because of its potential to bypass
the employer’s security measures. (GE 2 at 7) Further review of Applicant’s computer use
“discovered attempts to obscure Internet activity by using an anonymous proxy that would
hide the destination from [the employer’s] IT security systems, as well as frequent visits to
questionable download websites as far back as September 2015.” (GE 2 at 7)  Moreover,
Applicant was visiting websites that provided tutorials regarding how to crack passwords
and conduct network attacks, and that he had downloaded a copy of pirated software onto
the network. (GE 2 at 9) After an investigation, Applicant was terminated for violation of his
employer’s Internet use policy. (Answer at 1-2)
Applicant  admits  that  he  demonstrated  bad  judgment  accessing  some  of  his
“personal  stuff”  on  his  work  computer.  (Tr.  58)  However,  he  contends  that  he  visited
hacking-related websites for educational and professional development, and that cyber-
security experts need to understand how hackers operate in order to defend against them.
(Answer at 2; Tr. 56) He characterized this concept as “ethical hacking,” and testified that
he  was  earning  an  online  certification  in  this  field  while  he  was  working  for  his  former
employer.  (Tr.  54)  Applicant  contends  that  his  employer  allowed  him  to  use  the  office
computer for studying and practical assignments related to his certification during down
time. Also, Applicant testified that he made a mistake by not memorializing this permission
in writing. (Tr. 57-58; 119)
There were occasions on Applicant’s job when information technology specialists
might  need  to  visit  websites  related  to  hacking  for  research,  or  download  password-
cracking software to gain access to a system where a password was lost. These situations
were  exceedingly  rare.  (GE  2  at  8)  Applicant’s  employer  characterized  the  volume  of
hacking-related content combined with the absence of any specific project that required
that  type  of  information  “disconcerting,”  and  characterized  Applicant’s  behavior  as  a
demonstration  of  “incredibly  poor  judgment.”  (GE  2  at  9)  Subsequently,  Applicant  was
terminated from his job.
After Applicant’s termination, he completed the certificate in ethical hacking that he
had been working on while employed. (Tr. 69) In the past five years, he has completed
multiple trainings, including an insider threat training and two cybersecurity awareness
trainings. (AE B – AE E) He took these courses to ensure that mistakes such as those
which led to his termination in 2015, do not recur. (Answer at 2)
Applicant informed all of his subsequent employers of the circumstances related to
the 2015 termination. He is highly respected on the job. According to a coworker, he is “a
very trustworthy, hardworking, diligent individual,” whose knowledge of cybersecurity and
the rules that govern cybersecurity is unparalleled. (AE F)

"Under Guideline M, the Government alleged that in November 2016, Applicant was
fired for using a company laptop to view pornography between June and November 2016,
in violation of his employer’s policy for acceptable use of company information technology
(SOR 1.a). This conduct was cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct under Guideline
E  (SOR  1.b).  In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied,  with  explanations,  both  SOR
allegations. (Tr. 8 – 9) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old and employed since January 2019 as a program manager
for  a  defense  contractor.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  United  States  Marine  Corps
between  1993  and  1995,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged  after  becoming  physical
unable to serve any longer. Thereafter, Applicant worked and attended college, earning
an  associate’s  degree  in  1999  and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2003.  In  August  2012,  he
earned a master’s degree. (Answer; GX 1; AX F)
Applicant and his wife have been married since 2005 and have two children under
the age of 10. His wife also works for the same defense contractor (Company A) where
Applicant was employed between May 2015 and November 2016 as a project manager.
(GX 1; Tr. 25 – 26)
Applicant  has  worked  in  the  defense  industry  since  2003  for  five  companies
including  Company  A.  He  first  received  an  industrial  security  clearance  in  2004.
Throughout his career, Applicant has received training, usually on an annual basis, on a
variety  of  security-related  topics.  Company  A  records  show  that  on  June  1,  2016,  he
acknowledged receiving training in cyber security and on Company A policies regarding
the proper use of company computers and information technology systems. (GX 1; GX 4;
Tr. 8)
On June 8, 2016, Applicant accessed a pornographic website from his company
computer while at his permanent worksite and while connected to the company network.
This occurred when Applicant connected a personally-owned external hard drive to his
company computer. During a subject interview in September 2018, and in response to
the SOR, Applicant claimed that while reviewing the files stored on that hard drive, he
inadvertently clicked on the link for a pornographic website and that this was an isolated
incident. Although Applicant was allowed to connect the hard drive to his work computer,
accessing that website was a violation of company policy. When he clicked on the link, a
security notice appeared on his screen advising him that he had been detected “making
repeated  attempts  to  visit  improper  websites  with  a  classification  branded  for
inappropriate  material.”  The  incident  occurred  on  a  Wednesday,  but  Applicant’s
supervisor was not in the office until the following Monday, June 13. Applicant claims he
told his supervisor that day of the incident and that it was an inadvertent, one-time event.
He further claimed that his supervisor did not formally counsel him, but advised Applicant
to  avoid such websites  in  the future.  Applicant  interpreted  management’s response  as
tacit permission to his use of pornography sites, even on a company laptop, as long as it
was not during work hours or while connected to a company network. On Tuesday, June
14,  2016,  the  manager  of  the  Company  A  information  security  department  notified
Applicant that he again had been detected accessing inappropriate sites on his company
computer  on  Monday,  June  13,  2016,  the  same  day  he  purportedly  self-reported  his
earlier  conduct  to  his  supervisor.  Applicant’s  supervisor  also  was  advised  of  this  and
Applicant  was  warned  that  “continued  inappropriate  activity  will  initiate  a  full  security
investigation, possible seizure of [his company laptop] for forensic analysis, and further
report  (sic)  to  HR  and  the  Information  Systems  Security  Officer.”  Applicant  was  also
provided with a link to Company A’s “Security Information Technology Acceptable Use
Policy.” (Answer; GX 1 – 4; Tr. 26 – 29, 32 – 33)
Applicant continued to view pornography using his Company A laptop on at least
three other occasions between June 2016 and November 2016. Applicant admits doing
so, but he insisted that he was off-duty each time and was not connected to the company
information network when he accessed pornography sites. Applicant has further claimed
that he was not made aware of the Company A policy against using the laptop in that
way. Most of Applicant’s conduct in this regard occurred while Applicant was away from
home  on  work-related  travel  overseas.  Despite  this,  Company  A’s  information  security
organization  detected  numerous  websites  and  an  extensive  level  of  activity,  some  of
which involved sites that reflected an interest in underage girls. Applicant denied that he
ever viewed child pornography. He acknowledged that he has viewed pornography for
several  years.  The  LCSW  evaluation  on  January  29,  2020  found  no  disorder  or
compulsion associated with Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has also acknowledged that
he  understands  the  cyber  security  vulnerabilities  that  can  arise  when  one  accesses
websites such as those at issue here. He insists that he has learned his lesson, and his
wife has stated her confidence that Applicant no longer views pornography. (GX 1 – 4;
AX P; AX Q; Tr. 26 – 30, 47 – 57)
Applicant  presented  five  character  reference  letters,  four  of  which  indicated
Applicant had disclosed the reasons why his security clearance eligibility was in doubt. It
is not apparent, however, that Applicant disclosed all of the facts about his misuse of a
company laptop to view pornography. He also presented information that shows he has
been  an  excellent  employee  in  terms  of  his  performance  and  technical  expertise.  His
current employer has, so far, given him positive feedback about his performance over the
past year. (Answer; AX A – E; AX G; AX H; AX N; AX O)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 55-year-old communication system engineer, who was employed by
a DOD contractor from September 2007 to August 2018. (Tr. 6, 23, 25-26; GE 1) He was
recently hired by another DOD contractor. In 1987, he was commissioned in the Air Force.
(Tr. 8) He was deployed to Afghanistan from August 2005 to January 2006. (Tr. 9) His Air
Force specialty was information technology communications. (Tr. 10) In 2007, he retired
from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. (Tr. 8, 23) His highest award  was the Joint
Service Commendation Medal. (Tr. 9) He held a security clearance continuously since
1987  when  he  joined  the  Air  Force.  (Tr.  23-24)  In  2013,  he  was  granted  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 24)
In  1983,  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  and  in  1987,  he  received  a
bachelor’s degree with a major in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 1994, he received
his first master’s degree in information systems; in 2002, he received his second master’s
degree in military operational art and science; and in 2016, he received his third master’s
degree  in  science  and  religion.  (Tr.  7-8;  GE  1)  In  1998,  he  married  and  his  two  step
children are ages 34 and 38. (Tr. 12)
Sexual Behavior, Use of Information Technology, and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2 (use of information technology) and 3 (personal conduct) cross-allege
conduct that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1 (sexual behavior).
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant received verbal counseling on at least two occasions
for viewing pornographic websites from August 1998 to July 2001. (Tr. 34) On about two
or three occasions,  he  used his government-owned  desktop  computer in  his  Air  Force
office to access pornographic websites for 10 to 15 minutes on each occasion. (Tr. 35-
36, 75; GE 3) It was at the end of the duty day. (Tr. 35) He did not intentionally download
any pornography on his computer. (Tr. 38) He was verbally counseled and told to stop
accessing  pornographic  websites  with  his  government  computer.  (Tr.  38)  The  first
counseling did not seem to be with serious intent. (Tr. 39) “It was given to me with like a
wink” with an instruction to “knock it off.” (Tr. 39) The policy against using a government
computer to access pornography was informal and not well developed at that time. (Tr.
39-40) He acknowledged that his computer had access to sensitive information, and his
actions  could  have  compromised  that  information  technology  system  by  exposing  it  to
viruses and malware. (Tr. 41) At the time he was accessing the pornographic sites, he
was not thinking about the risk to sensitive information. (Tr. 41)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant received a letter of reprimand in about October 2004
while serving on active duty for misuse of a government computer. (Tr. 42) He admitted
that he accessed pornographic websites on a government-issued computer. (Tr. 42) The
computer he used was a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) computer that was in
a break area. (Tr. 32) The MWR computer was for general access to enable Air Force
employees to access their email, and the MWR computer was not assigned to Applicant.
(Tr. 42) He  went  to  two  or three pornographic  websites  over the  course  of one day  in
September 2004. (Tr. 42-43) He did not intentionally download any pornography on the
MWR computer. (Tr. 38) His computer misuse was detected through a computer log that
was  used  to  monitor  the  computer’s  use.  (Tr.  44)  There  was  no  evidence  that  the
pornography  was  downloaded  or  saved  on  the  MWR  computer.  (Tr.  45)  In  2004,  he
viewed  pornography  at  home  on  an  infrequent  basis.  (Tr.  46)  He  received  some
counseling from a licensed counselor to address his pornography issue; however, it was
ineffective. (Tr. 47) The letter of reprimand was for violation of a regulation under Article
92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). See. e.g., DOD Regulation 5500.7-R, Joint
Ethics Regulation, (Aug. 30, 1993), ¶ 2-301(2)(d). The reprimand adversely affected his
future assignments, and he was not selected for promotion to colonel. (Tr. 73) During his
November  7,  2007,  Office  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,
Applicant  said  he  learned  his  lesson  about  misuse  of  government  computers  after  his
reprimand in 2004. (Tr. 49; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used  an  employer-owned  computer  to  view
pornographic websites from about January 2018 to about July 2018. He resigned in lieu
of  being  terminated  by  his  employer  for  this  misuse  of  his  employer’s  computer.  He
viewed the pornography in his employer’s building in a conference room. (Tr. 50, 55) He
turned  off  the  virtual  private  network  (VPN)  connection  to  circumvent  or  bypass  his
employer’s  firewall.  (Tr.  59)  Switching  off  the  VPN  enabled  him  to  access  sites  his
employer would normally block. (Tr. 59) He acknowledged that by turning off the VPN he
engaged  in  “unauthorized  manipulation  of  an  information  system.”  (Tr.  59)  He  also
deleted the search logs after he went to the pornographic websites. (Tr. 72)
Applicant  viewed  pornography  once  or  twice  a  month  using  his  employer’s
computer, and he accessed the sites for one or two hours at a time. (Tr. 50; GE 3) He
accessed the sites during lunchtime or when things were slow at the office. (Tr. 51; GE
3) He estimated that he downloaded about 1,000 pictures but no videos, and he deleted
the pictures within 24 hours after downloading them. (Tr. 53-54) His employer did not find
any pornography on the computer he used to access pornographic websites. (Tr. 59) He
said  the  computer  he  misused  did  not  directly  affect  DOD.  (Tr.  30)  His  employer’s
computer did not directly access a DOD network; however, this computer did access his
employer’s  network.  (Tr.  30-31)  His  misuse  of  his  employer’s  computer  violated  his
employer’s policies and procedures. (Tr. 58) He committed multiple infractions because
after he misused his employer’s computer the first time, and nothing happened, he did
not believe his employer was serious about enforcement of prohibitions against accessing
pornography on his employer’s computers. (Tr. 55-57) He resigned from his employment
because he believed it was likely that he would be fired. (Tr. 57)
Applicant received routine annual briefings on security and information systems.
(Tr.  32-33)  Throughout  his  career,  Applicant  was  aware  that  he  was  not  permitted  to
access pornography websites or view pornography using government or his employer’s
computers.  (Tr.  31-32)  He  viewed  pornographic  websites  for  pleasure.  (Tr.  36)  He
became  sexually  aroused;  however,  he  did  not  masturbate  while  viewing  the
pornography. (Tr. 37, 52) He did not view child pornography. (Tr. 38) He conceded that
in  the  past  he  had  a  problem  with  or  addiction  to  pornography.  (Tr.  46-47)  Applicant
infrequently viewed pornography on his home computer from 2004 to 2018. (Tr. 49)
Theoretically,  when  Applicant  downloaded  a  pornographic  picture  onto  his
employer’s computer, that picture might have contained a virus that could be transferred
onto his employer’s network. (Tr. 75-76) The virus could be transferred via his employer’s
network onto a Microsoft Word document or PowerPoint presentation, and in turn, when
these items were sent to the DOD, the virus could be downloaded onto the DOD network.
(Tr. 75-76) Applicant was not thinking about possible penetration of security or creation
of  a  “backdoor”  into the  DOD network when he  was  looking at pornography  or visiting
pornographic websites using his employer’s computer. (Tr. 77)
Applicant reluctantly conceded that in the past he was “addicted” to pornography.
(Tr. 70) His viewing of pornography was a choice, and ultimately, he had the power  or
free will and could choose not to view pornography. (Tr. 70) He said that in the past he
had a compulsion to view pornography, and he “fell into a bondage area.” (Tr. 70)
Applicant met with his pastor on a weekly basis from August 2018 to about March
2019, and less frequently thereafter for counseling to help with his pornography issue.
(Tr. 62-66; SOR response) After July 2018, Applicant viewed pornography on his home
computer  on  only  one  occasion.  (Tr.  61)  He  disclosed  this  viewing  to  his  spouse  and
pastor. (Tr. 61) Occasionally his spouse attended the meetings with his pastor. (Tr. 64)
His  spouse  has  complete  knowledge  of  his  issue  with  pornography.  (Tr.  64)  Applicant
disclosed his misuse of computers involving pornography to security, coworkers, friends,
people  at  church,  and  family.  (Tr.  60,  66;  GE  3)  He  was  not  worried  about  public
disclosure of his past problem with pornography because of his success in his endeavors
to stop viewing pornography. (Tr. 67-68) He expressed his remorse for his involvement
with pornography. (Tr. 83)
Character Evidence
A  GS-15,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  14  years  in  a  professional  capacity,
described  Applicant  as  having  excellent  integrity  and  loyalty.  (SOR  response)  His
statement  supported  Applicant’s  access  to  classified  information.  (Id.)  In  2019,  he
received an annual merit increase and spot bonus increase from his employer for his hard
work. (AE B)
Applicant’s  pastor  has  provided  counseling  to  Applicant  since  July  2018.  (SOR
response)  He  said  Applicant  is “remorseful, repentant, and  stands  in  low  probability  of
improperly  using  any  PC  or  network  again.”  (Id.)  He  recommended  mitigation  of
Applicant’s issues. (Id.)
Applicant  described  himself  as  patriotic  and  loyal  to  the  government.  (Tr.  77)
“[T]here were no security incidents” during his decades of government service. (Tr. 77)
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. At the hearing,
his attorney moved to withdraw his answer to the SOR and substitute a modified answer
to the SOR. (HX V.) I denied the motion to withdraw his answer to the SOR on the ground
that there is no authority under the Directive permitting an applicant to withdraw an answer
to  the  SOR.  However,  I  granted  Applicant’s  motion  to  the  extent  that  I  allowed  him  to
submit explanations for his answer to the SOR. (Tr. 13-17.) His admissions in his original
answer to the SOR, his modified answer in HX V, and at the hearing are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old cyber-security analyst employed by a defense contractor
since  March  2018.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1986.  He  was  an  employee  of
another government agency for about five years. (Tr. 37.) He was employed by another
defense  contractor  from  July  2003  to  March  2018,  when  he  was  terminated  for  the
conduct alleged in the SOR. He married in May 1998 and has five children, ages 20, 19,
18, 15, and 14. He has held a security clearance since about 1999. (Tr. 70.)
In September 2017, Applicant sent an email to a co-worker, asking her to allow
him to use her security token to gain access to an unclassified server in order to perform
system  software  patching  and  troubleshooting.  The  security  token  is  a  small  piece  of
hardware  with  a  USB  plug  on  the  end.  (Tr.  86.)  His  security  token  had  been  recently
reissued  and  could  not  be  read  by  the  server.  The  compliance  date  for  updating  the
system was approaching, and the system would be taken offline if he could not complete
the updates. (Tr. 58.) His co-worker declined, telling him that she would be uncomfortable
allowing him to use her security token. His former employer’s security team intercepted
their  email  exchange.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  given  an  alternate  method  of
bypassing the token requirement, but it did not work. (Tr. 56-57.) He testified that he did
not ask his co-worker to install the security updates because she did not have the skill set
required to install them. (Tr. 68.)  He knew, based on training and the provisions of the
non-disclosure  agreement  that  he  signed,  that  employees  were  not  allowed  to  share
credentials. (Tr. 71.)
Based  on an internal investigation  by  the  corporate  counsel and  facility  security
officer in January and February 2018, Applicant was terminated on March 2, 2018. (GX
2.)  When  Applicant  submitted  his  most  recent  SCA  in  March  2018,  he  disclosed  his
termination and the attempt to use another employee’s security token. (GX 1 at 15.)
Applicant testified that he had submitted multiple requests for almost a month to
install a device driver that could read his new security token. (Tr. 41.) In the meantime,
he was unable to install the patches and security updates necessary to protect the system
from being hacked. (Tr. 44-45.) He testified that in hindsight he should have escalated his
problem  with his security token to his supervisors. (Tr. 47.) He testified that during the
investigation  the  corporate  counsel  asked  him  if  he  would  try  to  use  someone  else’s
security  token  again,  and  he  said  that  he  would  “if  it  would  get  the  job  done.”  When
reminded  by  the  corporate  counsel  that  he  had  signed  a  non-disclosure  agreement
prohibiting sharing of credentials, he responded, “Okay, I won’t do it.” (Tr. 64.)
Applicant testified that, in February 2018, the corporate counsel told him that they
had  observed  his  use  of  a  personal  thumb  drive  in  September  2017  to  transfer  work-
related  data  between  his  employer’s  unclassified  information  systems.  (Tr.  60.)  At  the
hearing,  he  admitted  that  he  started  using  a  thumb  drive  in  April  2017,  when  his
employer’s  system  was  migrated  into  a  government  system.  He  was  having  problems
with downloading software updates and security patches. He knew how to clean a thumb
drive to prevent transmitting malware. He did not connect the thumb drive to a government
network.  He  used  the  thumb  drive  to  transfer  data  from  his  contractor’s  laptop  to  his
government laptop on four occasions, in April, July, September, and November 2017. (Tr.
47-49.) He testified that the SOR was inaccurate when it alleged that he used the thumb
drive beginning in July 2003. The basis for alleging that Applicant used the thumb drive
from  July  2003  to  March  2018  is  not  in  the  record.  The  inclusive  dates  of  Applicant’s
unauthorized  use  of  a  thumb  drive  are  not  reflected  in  the  JPAS  incident  report.  He
testified that when he answered the SOR, he stated that he  admitted that he used the
thumb  drive  between  July  2003  and  March  2018  because  those  were  the  dates  of  his
employment by his former employer. He testified that he did not know that he could admit
part of the allegation and deny part of it. (Tr. 50.)
Applicant testified that he has never seen a document forbidding the use of thumb
drives. However, he admitted that during training he was clearly told that he should not
use thumb drives. (Tr. 52, 62.) However, he believed that the permissible devices such
as compact discs were the same as using a thumb drive and just as safe because he
knew how to “nuke” the thumb drive and remove any potential contamination. (Tr. 52-54.)
The JPAS incident report (GX 2) recited that Applicant was cautioned against using
the thumb drive and instructed to not use it again, and that “he replied that he could not
guarantee he would not do it again if he needed to accomplish his mission.”  Applicant
denied telling the investigators that he could not guarantee that he would not use a thumb
drive again. (Tr. 63-64.) He testified that he told the contractor’s counsel that he would
not use a thumb drive again but that he was uncomfortable leaving the system insecure.
(Tr. 64.)
Applicant’s  use  of  a  thumb  drive  and  his  attempt  to  use  a  co-worker’s  security
token occurred only on unclassified systems. He testified that a classified system is totally
different  with  very  stringent rules.  (Tr. 68.)  He  would  never  bypass  security  rules  on  a
classified system for efficiency. He believes that the rules for classified systems are about
security, not efficiency. (Tr. 65-66.)
The co-worker who declined Applicant’s request to use her security token testified
on his behalf. She has worked for Applicant’s former employer as a software engineer
since  May  2007.  She  regards  Applicant  as  very  responsible,  reliable,  honest,  and
trustworthy.  (Tr.  76-80.)  She  testified  that  Applicant’s  token  had  expired,  and  that  she
declined Applicant’s request to use her token, telling him that she did not feel comfortable
allowing him to use it and did not want to get their employer in trouble. She did not report
his request. Her opinion of Applicant did not change as a result of his request. (Tr. 82,
86.)
Another former co-worker who had worked with Applicant on a project for about
eight  years testified  that  she believes  he  is a  trustworthy,  reliable,  and honest person.
She testified that their employer allowed the use of thumb drives about ten years ago, but
the policy changed with the technology and everyone was notified by bulletins and emails
of the change. She testified that she believes Applicant knows that he made a mistake
and that he wants to do the right thing. (Tr. 90-96.)
A current co-worker has known Applicant for about four years and works with him
on the same project. He considers Applicant to have good judgment and believes he is
very  reliable,  trustworthy,  and  honest.  He  is  aware  of  the  reasons  Applicant  was
terminated by his previous employer, but believes Applicant had no malicious intent, but
“at the end of the day, he was just trying to get the job done.” (Tr. 98-103.)
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR answer, he admitted he had been terminated in 2011 from his
then employment for a computer-use violation (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant denied he violated
his  administrative  privileges  as  a  systems  administrator  between  April  2012  and
September 2014(SOR ¶ 1.b); denied he permanently disabled anti-intrusion software on
his  workstation(SOR  ¶  1.b.i.);  denied  placing  his  workstation  in  any  elevated  category
groups  within  an  active  directory  (SOR  ¶  1.b.ii.);  denied  modifying  his  system
configuration  to  violate  security  requirements  (SOR  ¶  1.b.iii.);  and  denied  violating  his
access privileges by accessing websites with inappropriate content, or uploading images
of women in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.c.i.). He admitted
his access to classified information was suspended in March 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d) for the
alleged violations of administrative and access privileges, but he was told only that there
had  been  “suspicious  activity.”  He  denied  being  involved  in  conduct  of  questionable
judgment under Guideline E, personal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 2 and 2.a). He denied falsifying
facts on his May 4, 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)
when he stated he left his employment in August 2011 due to end of contract and was
released from the contract under mutual agreement (SOR ¶ 2.b). He denied he had failed
to  disclose  on  his  July  31,  2017  e-QIP  the  full  extent  of  his  August  employment
termination. (SOR ¶ 2.c). (Ex. 3, 4) After considering the pleading, exhibits, and transcript,
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 45-year-old information technology (IT) support specialist who has
worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  June  2017  and  seeks  to  obtain  a  security
clearance. (Ex. 5) From May 1999 through August 2003, he honorably served in the U.S.
Marine Corps. (Ex. 4) In July 2009, he married, and in June 2016, he divorced. (Ex. 4) He
has two children, a son age 14 and a daughter age 11. (Ex. 4) His confidential clearance
eligibility was granted in May 1999, and suspended in March 2015. (Ex. 4, 5)
On  August  22,  2011,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  with  a
technology company when he plugged a hard drive into a government computer, which
held inappropriate content. (Ex. 6) He stated,
in August of 2011 there was a lapse of judgment and I made a mistake and
it  was  an  isolated  incident.  It  was  not  malicious  in  nature  and  under  no
circumstance was it meant to be a security breach or anything that would
endanger the government system. It was a simple lack of judgment which
cost me employment. (Tr. 12)
Applicant  explained  that  he  provided  IT  support  to  friends  not  part  of  his
government job. His barber gave him an external hard drive to check if it was functional
because it would not boot up. (Tr. 99, SOR Response) Instead of waiting to take the hard
drive  home  to  test  it,  he  plugged  it  into  his  work  computer.  When  he  discovered  the
contents  of  the  hard  drive,  he  immediately  unplugged  it,  but  his  action  was  a  security
violation.  He  acknowledges  his  actions  were  shortsighted  and  thoughtless.  (SOR
Response)  He  says  there  was  “no  excuse  or  justification  for  [his]  unethical  act,”  but
asserts this action was not characteristic of how he handled business before or after the
incident. (SOR Response) He stated, “I do freely admit that it was an error, a lapse in
judgment,  and  I  did  plug  into  a  hard  drive.”  (Tr.  83)  This  was  his  first  offense  at  the
company. (Tr. 84) He testified, “it was a lapse of judgment which I’m not running away
from it. This was back in 2011, and since then, of course, I’ve mitigated that and I’m very
mindful and very paranoid” about during security access. (Tr. 87) He asserts he was very
candid  about  the  incident  during  both  his  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
interviews. (Tr. 87)
The day after Applicant connected the hard drive, his violation was detected, and
Applicant  was  told  not  to  return  to  work.  (SOR  Response)  When  confronted  by  his
employer,  he  acknowledged  his mistake  and  did  not make  or offer any  excuse  for the
incident. The company was in the midst of a contract extension and re-bid of the contract
and he was told it was best that he be separated. (Tr. 86, SOR Response) He was told
he would not be given a second chance because the contract was ending, and retaining
him after the security incident might hurt the company’s chance of obtaining the contract.
(Tr. 87)
Applicant disclosed on his January 2012 e-QIP and again on his July 2017 e-QIP,
that  he  had  left  his  job  in  August  2011  by  mutual  agreement  following  allegations  of
misconduct. On both e-QIPs, he fully explained that he had plugged in a hard drive on his
work computer to test it. He stated that his then employer’s Network Operations Center
(NOC) had discovered the incident. He indicated that his actions were a security violation
and stated,
My  company  was  in  the  midst  of  recompete  efforts  with  [a  government
agency]. This would look bad for my old employer’s desire for recompete. It
was decided that it would be best if I were [sic] removed from the contract
for that reason. I was told it was a result of bad timing as opposed to the
violation  itself.  I  understood  violation  and  my  employment  with  [the
company] ended. (Ex. 1, Ex. 4)
In Applicant’s January 31, 2012, Declaration for Federal Employment to work as a
contract systems administrator for the U.S. military, he answered “yes” to question 12 that
asked if, during the previous five years, he had been fired from any job for any reason,
quit after being told that he would be fired, or left by mutual agreement because of specific
problems.  He explained  he  left  his previous employer  after mutual  agreement after he
had plugged a personal external hard drive into his work computer. He stated the incident
was deemed a security violation and, due to the timing of the incident, his employment
ended. He explained the contract he was working on was ending and the company was
in  negotiations  to  bid  on  a  new  contract.  (Ex.  2)  He  asserts he  had  no  intention  to  be
dishonest or have a lack of candor. (Tr. 88)
On Applicant’s May 2015 e-QIP, he answered “no” to all  employment  questions
concerning  being  fired,  quitting  after  being  told  he  would  be  fired,  leaving  by  mutual
agreement following allegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance, or having
received  a  written  warning,  reprimand,  suspension,  or  discipline  for  misconduct  in  the
work place. (Ex. 3) He gave as the reason for his employment ending in August 2011,
“End of contract. Released from Contract under mutual agreement.” (Ex. 3)
When asked about it during his OPM interviews, he told the investigators that his
answer was a mistake and he should have answered “yes” to the questions on the e-QIP.
(Tr.  107)  He  asserts  he  was  candid  throughout  the  investigation,  with  the  OPM
investigators, and during his hearing, and he was not deceptive or malicious. (Tr. 178)
On Applicant’s July 2017 e-QIP, he provided a long explanation for his termination.
(Ex. 4) He fully explained that his employment ended because he had plugged a hard
drive into his government computer, which was discovered by the NOC. He explained his
employer said it would look bad as the company was competing for an extension of the
contract, and it would be better if he was removed from the contract. (Ex. 4) The company
did  not  create  an  unfavorable  information  file  (UIF)  on  the  incident.  (Tr.  135)  He  is
remorseful about the incident. (Tr. 189) Before his initial hiring as a contractor in support
of the U.S. military, Applicant told his prospective employer what occurred at his previous
employment.  (Tr.  134)  The  company  checked  it  out  and,  according  to  Applicant,  his
previous employer related the same information Applicant had provided. (Tr. 134) The
contractor  at  JTFB  would  not  have  hired  Applicant  had  his  previous  employer
recommended he not be hired. (Tr. 136)
From April 2012 until September 2014, Applicant worked as a contractor in support
of the U.S. military at an overseas government location. (Ex. 5) He was employed along
with 17 or 18 other U.S. computer technicians; the prime contractor had an additional 24
to  25  U.S.  computer  technicians;  and  the  host  country  had  an  equal  number  of
technicians. (Tr. 146) The prime contractor dealt with computers and communications.
(Tr. 148)
Applicant initially worked in computer-desktop support before being promoted to
junior  systems  administrator.  (Tr.  75)  He  was  promoted  after  other  employees  were
terminated due to inappropriate actions. (Tr. 75) He was promoted to the NOC as a novice
learning the job. (Tr. 76) His duties were to create and delete email accounts, to monitor
the email server, to conduct morning security checks, and to operate the mail server. (Tr.
77, Tr. 94, SOR Answer) Daily and weekly scans were conducted of all computers, and
every  computer  was  required  to  have  HBSS  (host-based  security  system)  and  HIPS
(host-based  intrusion  prevention  system)  software  on  them.  (Tr.  94)  Applicant  had  no
knowledge about HIPS and no motivation to learn about HIPS. (Tr. 81) The HBSS was
the  software  responsible  for  implementation  of  anti-intrusion  tools  and  auditing.  (SOR
Answer)
HBSS and HIPS, which are designed for security over host-based systems dealing
with intrusion and infections are dealt with at the individual workstation level, are particular
to U.S. Government networks. (Tr. 67) HBSS and HIPS prevent plugging in a hard drive
through  a  USB  port.  (Tr.  31)  If  HBSS  was  not  installed  on  a  workstation  the  systems
administrators had to answer to the information assurance (IA) administrator. (Tr. 94)
In 2014, a civilian contractor at Applicant’s worksite was arrested and subsequently
convicted of espionage, child pornography,  and child-sex crimes, among  other crimes.
(Tr. 53, 132) Around the same time, another civilian contractor was also fired and arrested
for  criminal  activity.  (Tr.  16,  42) When  these  individuals  were  removed,  Applicant  was
given a promotion to work in the NOC. (Tr. 96)
As  part  of  the  FBI’s  investigation  into  the  criminal  conduct  of  the  arrested
contractors, the government witness, a cyber-security advisor (investigator), conducted
an onsite network security evaluation and checked the IT system for additional problems.
(Tr. 69), His findings are listed in Ex. 7. (Tr. 41) He looked for “back doors,” and removed
any  pornography  that  was  still  on  the  network.  (Tr.  17,  41)  He  reviewed  and  pulled
information from over 600 machines on the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR)
network. (Tr. 18) He was onsite for a week or more doing his inspection. (Tr. 70)
The  investigator’s  findings  from  the  June  2014  investigation  were  set  forth  in  a
September 9,  2014 email.  (Ex.7) It  was  asserted  that Applicant and  a  co-worker,  both
systems  administrators,  had  disabled  anti-intrusion  tools  on  their  workstations  and
information servers on the network they operated; there was improper placement of their
workstations into elevated category groups within the directory, which would allow the two
administrators to communicate unimpeded between workstations and servers while using
the same network account, which violated Defense Information Security Agency (DISA)
Security  Technical  Implementation  Guides  (STIGs);  and  Applicant’s  NIPR  workstation
had  accessed  websites,  which  contained  content  that  included  hate  groups  and  other
sites in violation of the IT system’s use policy.
The investigator testified that his job was simply to collect the information, identify
the issues, and present them. (Tr. 65) He explained that if the anti-virus or HBSS were
off, there would be a logo on the monitor with a red “X” showing the items were disabled.
(Tr. 66) The investigator discovered that Applicant’s domain administrator account was
also  added  to  the  local  administrator’s  group,  which  would  allow  Applicant  to  make
changes directly to his local machine as well as to servers and computers on the domain
as well. (Tr. 26) The investigator stated Applicant’s account was never in the work station,
but was in the server and should not have been there. (Tr. 167) The investigator stated,
“I can’t tell or see if he did it, however, it was in there and he had the accesses that would
have allowed for that.” (Tr. 167-168)
During the course his investigation, the investigator provided daily updates to the
command.  (Tr.  70)  An  out-briefing  was  given  to  the  command  listing  all  critical  issues
before  the  investigator  left  the  installation.  (Tr.  67)  Any  major  issues  or  major findings
were provided in an executive summary. (Tr. 68) About 80 percent of the information is
given on site. (Tr. 60) The information is provided to criminal investigators to determine if
anything illegal had occurred. (Tr. 68) After the information is collected it is reviewed and
referenced against known bad lists, reviewed for malware and nation-state activity, and
he then writes up a large report that goes into much more detail, which can sometimes
take two months. (Tr. 50, 60) The investigator prepared a report that was based on events
that occurred before the June 2014 inspection of the IT system that led to the discovery
of Applicant’s workstation in the elevated category group within the directory. A copy of
the  investigator’s  went  to  the  criminal  investigator  and  the  director  of  security  at  the
worksite. (Tr. 71) The report was based on events prior to the June 2014 inspection. The
Applicant’s  removal  from  the  installation  occurred  three  months  after  the  investigation
was completed, in September 2014. (Tr. 63)
the
three  months  after
In  September  2014,
investigator  completed  his
investigation, Applicant and a co-worker were told they had been reported for “suspicious
activity.” Applicant was removed from the installation, although he asserts he was never
given  any  specifics  as  to  the  basis  of  the  allegations  or  what  the  “suspicious  activity”
involved. Applicant and his employer made numerous requests to obtain information on
the alleged incidents. (Ex. 9) Six months after he left the country, he and his employer
still had not been told the nature of the  alleged misconduct. (Tr. 79) He learned  some
details through a Freedom of Information Act request. (Tr. 80)
Regarding allegations that Applicant had disabled the anti-intrusion tools (Tr. 30),
the event logs show the HBSS and HIPS were disabled multiple times. (Tr. 32) The IA
government administrator was the only person who had the ability to disable the HBSS.
(Tr. 168) The investigator stated having an account at the local administrator level would
allow Applicant to access HBSS and disable the anti-intrusion tools. (Tr. 169)
A cyber-security advisor (investigator) testified for the government at Applicant’s
hearing.  He  asserted,  and  Applicant  disagreed,  that  a  local  administrator  such  as  the
Applicant, had the ability to turn off and manipulate programs on specific machines. (Tr.
55) The AI administrator would call and say he wanted to turn the programs back on and
Applicant told him “no.” Applicant’s employer disagrees with this statement, stating the AI
administrator  was  responsible  and  had  the  authority  to  correct  any  violation  of  the
Defense  Information  Systems  Agency  (DISA)  standards.  (Tr.  139)  The  investigator
testified that the administrators started disabling the security programs themselves. (Tr.
55) There were daily and weekly scans performed by the AI administrator to make sure
HBSS was on all machines except for two administrator machines and one or two servers,
which  included  Applicant’s  machine.  (Tr.  48)  When  asked  by  Applicant  about  logs
showing he had been the person to disable the HBSS and HIPS, the investigator stated
“So it’s going to be tough for me to really identify but you had the access and ability.” (Tr.
63)
Applicant  had  a  personal  account  and  three  separated  administrative  accounts
which  maintained  12  servers.  His  computer  was  on  the  NIPR  network.  As  part  of  his
duties, he would occasionally have to access a Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR)
computer to create and delete accounts. He never had a computer or workstation on the
SIPR network. (Tr. 90, SOR Answer) There was a centralized SIPR computer that was
accessed by  all  systems administrators.  (Tr.  90)  Applicant  testified  that the  HBSS and
security breaches were said to be on the SIPR network. (Tr. 90)
Applicant’s  supervisor at  the time  of  Applicant’s  alleged  violations,  the  technical
lead and desktop supervisor and manager, said he does not believe Applicant had the
knowledge or experience to disable HBSS or to place his machine in a higher category
of access. He said he was “an outstanding desktop tech but you [Applicant] was a junior
sys admin, at best, so from my assessment, I don’t think that you had the skill set to pull
that part off.” (Tr. 156) “That” being the violations asserted such as disabling HBSS and
placing  his machine  in  a  higher category  of access.  He testified  Applicant  was  always
reliable and a stellar desktop technician, but when he moved to the NOC, he was new
and green, and it would take time for him to learn his job. He stated, “So the things he
was being accused to do, it just didn’t make sense with his skill set.” (Tr. 160) He said it
would  not  have  given  any  value  added  for  Applicant  to  take  the  initiative  to  try  to
circumvent  security  protocols  or  do  something  on  a  high-end  server.  (Tr.  163)  Any
problems with information assurance and HBSS would have been handled by Applicant’s
management and not by Applicant. (Tr. 162)
Applicant asserts he never placed his account on any elevated or restricted group.
(Tr. 78) He denied he had ever scanned his machine to determine the extent of his access
rights. (Tr. 187) Whenever he had to perform a task requiring elevated rights, he had to
have the assistance of more senior personnel. If he was helping a user who needed to
get on an approved website, a website that had initially been flagged, he would have to
contact the information assurance (IA) administrator to have the HBSS disabled. (Tr. 77,
121) The IA had a specific duty as the HBSS administrator to maintain the HBSS. (Tr.
139)  Applicant  acknowledged  he  believed  there  were  personal problems  between  him
and  the  IA  administrator.  (Tr.  83)  The  IA  worked  for  the  primary  contractor  and  not
Applicant’s  employer.  (Tr.  149)  Following  the  inspection,  the  IA  administrator  was
terminated from his position before Applicant was removed from the installation. (Tr. 78)
Applicant had been told he would be trained in how to operate the Domain Name
System (DNS) by a senior systems administrator. However, he was never trained in the
system  and  he  never  logged  onto  the  system.  (Tr.  80)  He  does  not  know  if,  by  being
selected to be trained to operate the DNS server, he had been elevated for inclusion in
an  elevated  category.  Someone  with  authorization  had  moved  him  to  the  restricted
organizational  unit  (OU).  He  had  no  idea  that  he  was  in  an  elevated  category  or  who
placed him in an elevated category. (Tr. 122)
Applicant  denies  ever  having  the  necessary  access  to  make  any  changes  to
configure or disable anti-intrusion tools. (Ex. 10) Those tools were administered by the IA
department. He stated he had no knowledge of how to configure or manipulate intrusion
tools. Nor did he have the knowledge to disable security settings without assistance. (Ex.
10)  Prior to  the annual DISA  inspection  in  July  2014,  the  same  account  served  as  his
administrator’s  and  user’s  account.  (Ex.  10)  After  being  told  that  to  comply  with  new
security  measures,  multiple  accounts  were  needed.  At  that  time,  old  accounts  were
disabled, and he was issued three administrator accounts. The reason for the security
measure  was  to  prohibit  unimpeded  communication  between  workstations  and
computers.  He  was  not  instrumental  and  did  not  take  part  in  the  creation  of  the  new
accounts. Nor was he involved in the placement of these accounts in any specific-security
category group. (Ex. 10) The accounts were created by the AI office. If the accounts or
workstations  were  placed  in  the  wrong  security  category,  it  was  done  without  his
knowledge, as he had nothing to do with the creation or placement of these accounts.
(Ex. 10) The only personnel who could place a workstation in an elevated status was an
administrator account possessed by the NOC supervisor or AI personnel.
The president of the company onsite in 2014 stated in an April 9, 2015 email that
the HBSS software had incorrect settings and had improper setup policies that prevented
requested and required software from being installed. Due to the HBSS, incorrect settings
and  policies,  all  software  that  had  utilized  the  directory  would  fail  immediately,  which
included  patches,  flash  patches,  and  Windows  security  updates,  all  of  which  were
required to be installed. Disabling and re-enabling the software occurred regularly. The
desktop support and systems administrators were prevented by the incorrect settings and
policies  from  making  the  network  safer  by  installing  required  security  updates  to  the
network. If the software was not temporarily disabled by the AI administrator, many of the
computers  on  the  network  would  not  have  been  properly  patched.  (Ex.  9)  Applicant
always  requested  assistance  from  the  AI  administrator  whenever  he  had  to  have  the
HBSS turned off.
The  company’s  president  also  said  there  were  no  cyber-incident  reports  filed,
which  would  have  included  log  files,  dates  of  proven  incidents,  login  records,  and
additional information that would show illegal software or illegitimate reasons for disabling
software in order to install required software and then re-enable the software. (Ex. 9) The
HBSS failed the July 2014 DISA inspection due to improperly implemented policies and
lack of training and policy templates that could have easily prevented the need to disable
the software in order to install all other forms of software, patches, and security updates.
(Ex. 9)
After his removal from the jobsite, Applicant stayed at the overseas location from
September until November 2014, hoping to get the matter resolved and return to work.
(Ex.  5)  He  eventually  found  out  that  his  clearance  had  been  flagged  for  misuse  of
unauthorized access and compromising government security. (Ex. 5) He contacted the
Inspector  General  (IG)  for  the  Defense  Security  Services  (DSS)  and  was  told  his
clearance  was  pending,  and  he  should  wait  for  resolution  of  the  investigation.  In  May
2016,  Applicant  contacted  his  congressman  in  an  attempt  to  resolve  the  issue.  The
investigation was adjudicated in April 2017. (Ex. 5) Although his clearance is suspended,
the original contractor he worked for at JTBF is still sponsoring his clearance application.
(Ex. 5)
Regarding  the  hate-group  content  that  was  on  his  machine  in  2014,  Applicant
explained  that,  from  December  2007  to  August  2011,  he  worked  as  a  contractor for  a
federal law enforcement agency. In 2008 or 2009, while he was on temporary duty (TDY)
in  Washington  DC,  he  met  a  coworker  who  was  working  for  the  same  agency.  The
coworker needed work done on his computer. (Tr. 91, Tr. 114) Applicant helped him with
his computer problem and told the individual he could contact him if he had additional
computer  problems.  Applicant  did  not  associate  with  the  individual  and  they  were  not
friends. (Tr. 126) In January 2014, while overseas, Applicant learned the individual had
founded a web site that was considered a hate site. The individual was later charged with
operating a hate group. (Ex. 5) When Applicant learned the individual had been arrested
he went to various sites to learn about the individual and about the arrest. (Tr. 113) He
made the searches to learn about the individual. (Tr. 127) Applicant stated he had never
accessed any hate group or had knowingly associated with any hate group members.
It was alleged Applicant’s computer also had a large cache of hundreds of pictures
of women that were cataloged and detailed by type and other attributes, which was not
criminally illegal in nature, but did violate NIPR use policy. (Ex. 7, Ex. 8) Applicant denies
the  allegations.  (Ex.  10)  He  asserts  he  never  accessed  a  website  with  content  that
violated the acceptable use policy. (SOR Answer) He never received either a verbal or
written notification by his supervisor of inappropriately accessing websites. He had photos
on  his  computer,  but  the  pictures  were  not  unacceptable  nor  a  violation  of  what  is
publically deemed acceptable violating the acceptable use policy. (SOR Answer) He also
denies there were hundreds of pictures.
The investigator testified most of the pictures of women appeared to come from
Facebook and none were pornographic. (Tr. 37) Applicant stated all photographs came
from Facebook and did not violate the terms of his computer  use. (Tr. 89) There were
over  100  photos  of  women  on  Applicant’s  workstation,  which  was  not  illegal,  but  the
investigator asserts were against policy. (Tr. 38) The investigator had reviewed a few of
the photos. (Tr. 58) He said “I only looked into a few to see enough that I needed to see.”
(Tr. 166)  The  investigator  did  not  review  all  of  the files.  (Tr. 65)  One  photo  he  viewed
reportedly was of a topless woman bending over a motorcycle. (Tr. 58) There were no
zone identifiers of those files, and the investigator stated they “probably could” have come
from Facebook. (Tr. 59) The photos were not shown to be pornographic. (Tr. 39) These
photos were under the Applicant’s user profile. (Tr. 39)  It was alleged the photos were
organized into different folders. (Tr. 56) Applicant states there were no more than three
folders, asserts all photos came from Facebook, and none contained nudity. (Tr. 125) He
says Facebook had filters that prevent such nude photographs. (Tr. 116) He vehemently
denied any intention to view pornographic images. (Tr. 82)
Applicant asserts all the pictures came from Facebook and public profiles and were
not pornographic. (Tr. 81) He stated,
I  vehemently  dispute  the  willingness  to  look  at  anything  pornographic,
anything illegal or anything of that nature that I felt would violate the terms
of  use.  Those  were  public  profile  pictures,  and  none  of  which  were
pornographic. (Tr. 82)
In  Applicant’s  September  2017  enhanced  subject  interview,  he  stated  he
discovered through a FOIA response that he was suspected of disabling intrusion tools,
which granted his workstation improper placement on elevated category groups. During
the interview, he stated he had no knowledge of how to configure his machine,  did not
have rights to alter his software, and did not have access to carry out the task. (Ex. 5) He
said he did not know what happened, and was not involved in any way. In his June 2016
and September 2017 interviews, he indicated his clearance had been suspended. The
suspension was discussed in his June 2016 interview. (Ex. 5)
Applicant’s employer was given very little information about what happened and
never had a chance to actually look at the evidence, make a response to it, or provide an
explanation.  (Tr.  132)  Although  as  a  junior  employee  Applicant  had  the  least
responsibility, he was listed as backup on organizational charts because every position
required a second systems administrator to be listed for every server or function. (Tr. 137)
His employer attests Applicant was still learning did not have the skill set and knowledge
to perform many systems administrator tasks. (Tr. 137)
Character Information
The president of the company for which Applicant worked as a contractor in 2014
stated Applicant “was professional, competent, honest, and showed no signs of being a
security risk. From what we have been able to learn thus far about the alleged security
incident, it is our opinion that he is not guilty of the accusations. . .” (SOR Answer) He
testified the actions listed in the incident summary would have been out of character for
Applicant and impossible for Applicant to execute based on the level of access Applicant
had  in  his position as junior systems  administrator. The  incident  report  disregards that
certain  network  security  tools  were  disabled  by  senior  systems  administrators  with  full
knowledge  of  the  U.S.  military,  local  IA  staff,  and  DISA  inspectors  due  to  technical
problems with the government network. (SOR Answer)
Applicant’s  manager  and  direct  supervisor  from  2015  through  2017  are  of  the
opinion  Applicant  was  a  truly  valuable  asset.  He  showed  himself  to  be  honest,
dependable, and incredibly hard-working. He was an impressive problem solver who was
always able to address complex and challenging issues with confidence. (SOR Answer)
He has never improperly handled any company equipment or sensitive information. He
was not written up or disciplined for any behavior. The manager stated Applicant was a
10
true team player, a joy to work with, and a dedicated and knowledgeable employee. (SOR
Answer)
Applicant’s  supervisor  overseas  during  his  work  for  the  U.S.  military  stated
Applicant  was  always  extremely  detail-oriented  and  never  mishandled  classified
information,  sensitive  data,  or  customer’s  Personally  Identifiable  Information  (PII).  He
never  received  a  single  customer  complaint  about  Applicant.  (Ex.  A)  Applicant  was  a
trusted  and  well-valued  member  of  the  team.  Given  the  opportunity,  he  would  hire
Applicant  without  reservation  as  well  as  recommend  him  for  other  IT  positions,  either
civilian, contractor, or federal. (Ex. A)
",True
"Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  senior  cybersecurity  engineer  and  security  control
assessor/validator currently employed by a defense contractor since December 2017. He
has also been employed as a consultant part-time by another defense contractor since
2016. He received his high school general equivalency degree (GED) in 2002. Applicant
enlisted in the Army in 2003 and served honorably on active duty until 2007. During his
enlistment, he deployed to Iraq where he sustained significant injuries during combat in
2004.  He  has  since  been  awarded  a  VA  Disability  Rating  of  70%.  Applicant  served
honorably  in  the  Army  National  Guard  from  2009  until  2012.  He  married  in  2006  and
divorced  in  2009,  and  has  an  11-year-old  daughter  from  this  marriage.  Applicant  was
granted his first security clearance in 2008. (GX 1.)
The SOR consists of allegations under Guidelines E and M. Under Guideline E, ¶¶
1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant was terminated from two employers, in part, for failure
to perform audits as required by the National Industry Security Program Operating Manual
(NISPOM). This conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline M, ¶ 1.a. The SOR allegations
and Applicant’s responses to them, are discussed more fully below.
SOR Allegations
Applicant was terminated from Company A in 2016 for failing to complete
his job responsibilities
Applicant worked or Company A from January 2016 until August 2016 as a
systems  security  manager.  SOR  ¶  1.a  stems  from  this  employment.  The  SOR
alleges:
SOR ¶ 1.a: Alleges:
You  were  terminated  from  your  employment  at  [Company  A]  in  about
August 2016 for labor mischarging, which is a violation of [Company A’s] code of
ethics and business conduct, along with failing to complete mandatory NISPOM
required audits.
In response to SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant admits in his Answer that he was terminated
from his employment in August 2016, but denies the alleged conduct that resulted in his
termination. He states that despite his efforts to determine the reason for his termination,
to include filing an ethics complaint (which was found to be without merit), he did not know
the reason he was terminated until he received the Government’s discovery. He further
contends that the fact that he successfully claimed unemployment benefits is evidence
that  he  was  not  terminated  for  cause.  Additionally,  he  denies  overcharging  his  hours,
stating “my pay was always correct, if I had falsified my timecard my paycheck should
have been different or changed.” He supports this statement by providing copies of his
May to September 2016 bank statements. (AX L.)
An  August  8,  2016,  JPAS  incident  report  states  an  internal  investigation  into
Applicant’s  conduct  was  underway  because  software  patches  were  not  completed  as
necessary,  audits  were  not  performed  weekly,  and  there  was  potential  adverse
information concerning timecards. (GX 5.)
The  Government  presented  a  January  24,  2017,  letter  from  Applicant’s  former
employer’s facility security officer (FSO) to DSS. (GX 7.) The letter that states that the
internal  investigation  concluded  that  Applicant  “was  consistently  over  reporting  time
worked.” The  conclusions  of  the  investigation  were  “based  on  badging  data  and  video
evidence that was obtained from our Security Operations Center along with network login
data  and  cell  phone  records  obtained  from  our  Incident  Response  Team.”  The
investigation  also  concluded  that  Applicant  had  “failed  to  conduct  mandatory  NISPOM
required audits and software updates on classified systems.” The letter also noted that
“all auditing and software updates have been completed and it was determined that there
was no loss or compromise of classified data due to this finding.” (GX 7.)
Applicant  described  his  job  responsibilities  as  “the  facility  security  officer,
[community  security]  custodian,  the  information  system  security  manager,  the  offsite
program manager, that was it.” (Tr. 90.)
Based on the findings of the investigation, Applicant’s employer determined that
Applicant  was  in  violation  of  its  code  of  ethics  and  business  conduct  and  NISPOM
requirements  and  terminated  Applicant  in  August  2016.  The  letter  also  stated  that  all
auditing and software updates had since been completed and that no classified material
had been compromised. (GX 7.)
Applicant refutes the findings of investigation set forth in the January 2017 letter.
He  testified  that  he  completed  all  audits  as  required  and  that  he  properly  reported  his
hours.  (Tr.  30-31.)  He  also  stated  that  the  fact  that  he  was  eligible  for  unemployment
benefits is evidence that he was not fired for cause. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant presented a May 3, 2019, letter from a former off-site FSO of the 2016
employer  to  refute  the  Government’s  evidence.  The  former  FSO  worked  for  the  2016
employer  January  2006  until  January  2019.  Her  tenure  included  Applicant’s  period  of
employment. She did not directly supervise Applicant in his FSO responsibilities, but he
did report to her department. She stated that he did  not have any security incidents or
violations and that he successfully passed two Defense Security Service (DSS) audits.
DSS routinely conducts security vulnerability assessments to assess compliance with the
provisions  of  NISPOM  and  evaluate  facilities’  programs  for  protecting  classified
information in compliance with current directives. (AX M.) The former FSO further stated
that  she  had  known  Applicant  for  five  years  and  strongly  recommends  continuing  his
security clearance. (AX W.)
The former FSO states that she reviewed the January 2017 letter and states “with
a degree of certainty that the evidence collected against [Applicant] could not be possible
for the following reasons:
1)  The closed area (classified workspace) where Applicant worked did not have
badging capabilities;
2)  The closed area contains classified materials, and there are no video recording
devices within the facility for this reason;
3)  The  closed  area  contains  a  classified  network  that  is  not  connected  to  the
Internet.    It  would  not  have  been  possible  to  obtain  Applicant’s  login  data
records because there is no external connection;
4)  The employer did not allow company applications, to include email, on personal
mobile devices, therefore it would not have been possible to obtain Applicant’s
personal cell phone records.
The  former  FSO  also  states  that  she  prepared  for  a  DSS  audit  immediately
following Applicant’s termination, although she does not specify the date the audit was
performed.  She  states  that  when  she  conducted  the  audit,  it  showed  that  all  required
audits had been properly completed and were in compliance with NISPOM, and that there
were no missing software updates.
Applicant testified that the employer installed a badge reader on an external door
shortly before Applicant’s termination. (Tr. 94.) Additionally, he also stated that he was
required to log in to the company’s internal network to utilize the company’s email. (Tr.
130.)
Applicant was terminated from Company B in 2014 for failing to complete
his job responsibilities
Applicant worked or Company B from April to November 2014 as an information
security manager. SOR ¶ 1.b stems from this employment. The SOR alleges:
SOR ¶ 1.b: Alleges:
You  were  terminated  from  your  employment  at  [Company  B]  in  about
November  2014  for  failure  to  perform  an  audit  on  a  computer  used  to  process
classified information as required by the NISPOM Section 8-602a. You completed
a  tracking  log  indicating  you  perform  the  audit  on  October  24,  2014,  and  when
confronted about the audit, you continued to claim you had completed the audit. A
subsequent  investigation  determined  you  did  not  complete  the  audit  and  were
capable for falsifying business/government records and not acting in accordance
with the [Company B] code of ethics.
In  his Answer, Applicant  denies SOR  ¶  1.b and  sets forth  several bases for his
denial. First, Applicant states that he does not believe that he was “fired from his position.”
He  bases  this  statement  on  the  facts  that  he  successfully  collected  unemployment  as
being “laid off,” the employer did not protest his unemployment claim, and that he was not
required  to  reimburse  the  company  for  his  relocation  funds  as  he  would  have  been
required to do if he had been terminated for cause.
In his Answer and testimony, Applicant further supports this position by referencing
an email exchange he had with a former coworker wherein Applicant stated that he told
a potential employer that he had been “downsized.” In this same email, Applicant states
that his former manager and a human resources (HR) representative would not provide
him with any information as to why he was “let go, just that [he] was.” He characterizes a
statement made by the former coworker in an email “no one is saying what happened.”
Applicant  submitted  an  email  exchange  with  HR  wherein  HR  stated  that  it  would  not
provide  Applicant  with  a  copy  of  the  JPAS  incident  report  (GX  5)  concerning  his
termination or any documentation concerning why he was “dismissed,” and that he did
not need to complete any forms in order to apply for unemployment. (Tr. 34-35; AX N.)
Applicant also noted during his testimony that he was offered another position with the
employer in another state approximately three weeks after he was terminated. (Tr. 35.)
However, Applicant testified that in 2014:
APPLICANT:  I  was  --  same  thing,  human  resources  called  me  into  their
office and just said that I was terminated and that was it. I wasn't given any
reason.
ADMIN. JUDGE: So that was in November of 2014, you were --
APPLICANT: Yes.
ADMIN. JUDGE: -- they told you, you were fired?
APPLICANT: Yes, ma'am.
ADMIN.  JUDGE:  But  you  didn't  put  that  on  your  security  clearance
application?
APPLICANT: Well not fired, just terminated, and then I --
ADMIN. JUDGE: Well what do you think terminated means?
APPLICANT: I attempted to find out after, what the reason was.
ADMIN. JUDGE: What do you think terminated means?
APPLICANT: I don't know ma'am. It could mean anything. (Tr. 87-88.)
The second basis of Applicant’s denial of SOR ¶ 1.b is that his “position did not
include  performing  audits  on  computers.  This  was  the  responsibility  of  [a  coworker].”
(Answer.)
During  his  testimony,  Applicant  made  the  following  assertions  regarding
performing audits:
1)  It was not Applicant’s job to perform NISPOM audits, and he did not have
the  necessary  authorizations  to  do  them.  Performing  NISPOM  audits
was the responsibility of his coworker. (Tr. 35-36.)
2)  The  audits  were  divided  into  the  technical  part  and  the  policies  and
procedures part. It was Applicant’s coworker’s responsibility to perform
the technical part of the audits and Applicant’s responsibility to perform
the policy and procedure part of the audits. (Tr. 62-63.)
3)  Applicant never performed any of the audits. (Tr. 70.)
4)  Applicant described audits in general as being about 90% policies and
procedure and 10% technical. (Tr. 92.)
5)  Applicant  and  his  coworker  performed  as  a  team  wherein  Applicant
performed the policy and procedure part of the audits and his coworker
performed  the  technical  part  because  Applicant  did  not  have  the
required credentials to do so. (Tr. 128-129.)
The  conduct  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  based  on  a  November  11,  2014,  JPAS
incident  report  (GX  5)  and  the  employer’s  report  of  findings  of  an  investigation  dated
November 20, 2014. The report of investigation states:
The investigation determined that [Applicant] failed to perform an audit on
a  computer  used  to  process  classified  information  as  required  by  the
NISPOM section 8-602a. In addition,  [Applicant]  recorded an entry  in  the
audit log book indicating that he did in fact complete the audit on October
24, 2014. Finally, [Applicant] was not truthful when confronted about this.
This  security  incident  was  the  result  of  an  intentional  disregard  for  the
NISPOM  requirements  and  of  the  [company’s]  Code  of  Ethics.  The
investigation deems [Applicant] culpable for an intentional security incident
and as a result his employment with the company was terminated. (GX 4.)
The  report  lists  the  individuals  involved  in  the  investigation,  one  of  whom  is  a
contractor.  The  report  sets  forth  details  of  conversations  between  Applicant  and  the
contractor  regarding  Applicant’s  performance  of  an  audit  on  classified  computer  #6,
nicknamed “Poseidon.” The report also includes an email exchange between Applicant
and the contractor wherein Applicant represents that he performed the audit on October
24, 2014, but forgot to record an entry in the safe logbook.
The report also gives details of a meeting and conversation between Applicant and
his supervisor. Applicant’s supervisor, who was also the FSO, confronted Applicant about
routinely  submitting  inaccurate  and  incomplete  reports  and  asked  if  Applicant  had
performed the required audit. Applicant again confirmed that he had.
The  report  then  delineates  the  process  of  the  investigation  that  unequivocally
concluded  that  Applicant  did  not  perform  the  required  audit  on  the  classified  computer
Poseidon  on  October  24,  2014,  as  he  recorded  in  the  logbook  and  represented  in
conversations, emails, and during a meeting.
Following  the  investigation,  the  HR  manager  and  the  ethics  officer  interviewed
Applicant about  the  results  of  the  investigation and  Applicant again  stated  that  he had
completed the audit as required. Applicant was terminated for his conduct.
Applicant refutes the report of investigation on the following bases:
1)  Applicant never met the contractor and does not know who he is;
2)  Applicant confirmed that his email address was accurate, but stated he
never exchanged emails with the contractor;
3)  Applicant was out of state on vacation at the time of these incidents;
4)  Applicant  was  never  confronted  by  his  supervisor  about  his  job
performance;
5)  Applicant was never interviewed about the results of the investigation.
(Tr. 37-39; Tr. 74-77.)
Applicant also testified that the report was inaccurate because classified computer
#6 was not nicknamed Poseidon. According to Applicant, Poseidon was the name of a
computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining tool on which audits were not only not
required, but could not be performed. (Tr. 72-73.)
Applicant submitted a January 27, 2014, letter from DSS to the 2014 employer’s
FSO. Although prior to Applicant’s employment, the letter states that DSS conducted a
security  vulnerability  assessment  at  the  facility  and  rated  it  “commendable.”  The
assessment  found  six  vulnerabilities,  which  are  delineated  in  the  letter.  The  fourth
vulnerability,  which  was  corrected  on  the  spot,  was:  “Security  relevant  objects  are  not
audited for failed access.” It lists the systems effected, which includes “Poseidon.” (AX
T.)
Finally, during his testimony Applicant asserted, for the first time, that the events
as described in the report could not have happened because he was visiting his daughter
in another state on the specified dates. In support of this assertion, Applicant submitted
by email attachment three copies of photographs of him with his daughter. (AX X  – AX
AA.)
Each photograph is attached to the email as a “JPG” file, which is “a computer file
format for the compression and storage of digital images.” (merriam-webster.com.) The
photographs in the JPG files can be opened on a computer to view/print. The JPG file
names  appear  as  “10.26.14  Picture.jpg;”  “10.30.14  Picture.JPG;”  and  “10.23.14
Picture.JPG.” The email states that “each JPG can have the metadata shown by simply
clicking  on  file  info  on  the  picture  itself.”  The  metadata  includes  the  date,  time,  and
location of where the picture was taken. (AX Y.) However, this type of metadata can be
edited  using  widely  available  smartphone  applications  such  as  “pixelgarde”  and
“metapho.” Applicant did not offer any other evidence to corroborate the dates his travel.
Applicant  failed  to  properly  disclose  the  2014  and  2016  employment
terminations  on  a  security  clearance  application  and  in  two  background
interviews.
SOR  ¶  1.d:  Alleges  that  when  Applicant  answered  “no”  on  his  e-QIP  on  November  1,
2016, “no” to Section 13C, which asks: in the last seven years, have you been “fired from
a job” he falsified material facts by  deliberately failing to disclose his terminations from
two employers as set forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
Applicant denies this allegation in his Answer and states:
I did not falsify information on the e-QIP. I do not believe I was terminated
from this employer. If I was terminated I would have listed this on the e-QIP
form. I did not deliberately fail to disclose anything.
It  is  unclear from  Applicant’s  Answer  whether  he  is  referring  to  the  2014  or  the
2016  employer.  However,  Applicant  received  a  letter  from  his  2016  employer  dated
August 22, 2016, which stated that Applicant was terminated effective that same day. (AX
K.)
Applicant also testified that he filed an ethics complaint with the 2016 employer to
determine why he was terminated.
DEPARTMENT  COUNSEL:  I  don't  see  your  ethics  claim  in  here.  Do  we
have a copy of your ethics claim?
APPLICANT: No. I don't have a copy.
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What was in it to your best recollection? What
did you allege? What was the concern?
APPLICANT: I wanted to know why I was fired, why they sent me home,
basically just to really find out what happened and then I received that letter.
In a November 24, 2014, email to HR, Applicant stated “I have a right to know what
information  was  submitted  into  JPAS  on  my  clearance  especially  since  it  was
recommended that my accesses be revoked.” When queried by Department Counsel why
he did not disclose the JPAS incident report on his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he did not
know  what  information  was  in  the  incident  report and  that  “anything  can  be entered  in
JPAS for any reason.”
SOR ¶ 1.e: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during a personal subject
interview (PSI) on January 25, 2018, when he stated that he did not know the reason for
his termination from the 2016 employer.
In his Answer, Applicant denies this allegation and contends that he did not know
the  reason for his  “termination.” He  testified  that  he  did not find  out  the  reason for his
termination until he received the Government’s discovery in December 2018. (Tr. 49.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during a PSI on November
2, 2017, when he stated that he was laid off from his 2014 employment, but was in fact
deliberately concealing that he had been terminated.
In his Answer, Applicant denies this allegation and states:
I was laid off from this employer and filed and collected unemployment for
being laid off. The information contained in the SOR is false. I also made
attempts to obtain the reason why I was let go from HR and other employees
and was given no information at all.
In his 2017 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that  he was laid off for unknown
reasons with about 30 other people. (GX 2.) In an email exchange asking a coworker to
be a reference, Applicant stated that he had told a potential employer that he had been
“downsized”  because  HR  and  Applicant’s  supervisor  would  not  provide  him  with  “any
information as to why I was let go, just that I was.” (AX N.) On his 2016 e-QIP, Applicant
listed the reason for leaving his 2014 employer as “unknown. Reason for termination was
never provided by employer. Unemployment claim was not contested. Reason given by
employer to [another state] unemployment office was I was laid off due to lack of work.”
(GX 1.)
As set forth above under SOR ¶ 1.b, Applicant was called into the HR office and
told he was terminated.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  Alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  material  facts  on  a  resume  that  he
submitted  for  employment  in  October  2016  when  he  reported  that  he  obtained  a
bachelor’s degree from [a university] in August 2011 with a 3.8 GPA.
Applicant  submitted  the  resume  for  employment  with  Company  C,  where  he
worked from to October 2016 until October 2017 as an information systems security and
technology manager. In his Answer, Applicant admits in part and denies in part SOR ¶
1.g. Applicant admits that he did not graduate from the university, and did not take any
classes there. He states that he enrolled with the intent of attending, and August 2011
10
would have been his projected graduation date. He further states that he received the 3.8
GPA after transferring credits from “prior training and military service” to the university.
Applicant also stated that it was not his “intent to defraud or make a false claim of having
a bachelor’s degree.”
Applicant also attached with his Answer a biography. The document is undated,
however, he  describes  work experience  through  October 2017.  Applicant  states  in  the
document that he dropped out of high school and then received a GED in August 2002.
There is no reference to any attendance of or enrollment in any college or university. (AX
A.)
In his January 2018 PSI, Applicant confirmed that he had not graduated with any
college degrees or taken any college classes within the last 10 years. When confronted
about  the  resume  he  submitted  that  stated  that  Applicant  had  graduated  from  [a
university] with a bachelor’s degree in August 2011. Applicant stated that he did not take
any classes at the university, but that he did accumulate college credits for his military
training and work experience. (GX 2.)
In  his  August  2018  responses  to  the  Government’s  interrogatories,  specifically
when  asked  to provide  copies of  all  college  transcripts  and  diplomas for all  completed
degrees,  Applicant  responded  “I  do  not  possess  any  college  transcripts  or  diplomas.  I
have no completed degrees. I only have a GED.” (GX 3.)
However, Applicant also reported on his 2016 resume that he was enrolled in a
university in a dual Master of Science in Cybersecurity with a 4.0 GPA and a Bachelor of
Science in Information Technology with a 4.0 GPA with an anticipated graduation date of
April 2019. (GX 6.) He testified that the university was primarily on-line and that he had
completed approximately 18 courses. He further testified that he was in the process of
transferring his credits from this university and another (not previously mentioned) college
where he had gotten credits for his military training to another on-line university starting
in August 2019. He hoped to complete his degree by December 2019. (Tr. 110; Tr. 134-
136.)
Applicant completed a talent profile as part of his job application for the employer
to whom he submitted his 2016 resume. (AX H.) Under the education section, he did not
list the false information regarding his 2011 bachelor’s degree and 3.8 GPA. However, he
listed the university with the dual master’s and bachelor’s programs and stated that he
had been attending that university from January 2016 until the present. (GX 6.)
When asked by Department Counsel why he provided this false information on his
2016 resume, Applicant responded:
APPLICANT:  I  had  placed  it  on  my  resume  years  ago  and  it  had  a
graduation date I think of 2011, and 24 then it was just -- it stayed on my
resume.
11
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Now why'd you put a graduation date in for a
program that you never took a class in?
APPLICANT:  No  I  don't  mean  a  graduation  --  I  mean  like  a  projected
graduation date. (Tr. 58-59.)
Applicant  also  offered  testimony  as  to  why  his  2016  resume  contained  false
information:
I  remember enrolling  in  [the  university]  back  in  2008, I  transferred  all  the
credits I had there, which is where the GPA had come from. I had placed it
on an older version of my resume with the graduation date of 2011 and then
I hadn't taken it off my resume.  (Tr. 114.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on a resume he submitted
for  employment  with  [Company  B]  in  April  2014  when  he  reported  that  he  obtained  a
bachelor’s degree from [a university] with a GPA of 3.8.
The 2014 resume listed the city and state where the university was located, the
2016 resume did not. The 2016 resume included a “completion” date of August 2011, the
2014 resume did not. Additionally, the font and formatting are different on the 2014 and
2016 resumes.
In his Answer, Applicant’s response to this allegation is the same as his response
to SOR ¶ 1.g.
Applicant has failed to resolve the outstanding balance on his Company B
travel credit card
SOR ¶ 1.c: Alleges that Applicant failed to pay a collection account of $1,528 on
a credit card issued by Company B in about October 2014, and that the account remains
delinquent.
The  debt  is  verified  by  a  2018  credit  report,  Applicant’s  statements  during  his
November 2017 PSI, and his testimony. According to Applicant, the balance owed is for
expenses for his out-of-state travel for training in November 2014 and should have been
paid by his employer. In his responses to interrogatories, Applicant states that the account
was paid. He testified that he submitted his expense report to HR prior to his termination
on November 17, 2014. He further testified that he has done online disputes of this debt
multiple  times.  He  also  stated  that  he  has  written  multiple  letters,  faxed  letters,  and
contacted various branches of the financial Institute that issued the credit card and there
is no record of his name or Social Security number in their systems. (Tr. 44-46.) Applicant
did not submit any copies of these dispute letters into the record.
On November 18, 2014, Applicant was provided with a form from HR via email to
submit his expense report and receipts. On November 20, 2014, Applicant responded to
HR  stating  that  HR  should  receive  the  expense  report  by  the  following  week.  (AX  N.)
Applicant did not submit a copy of the completed expense report into the record.
On August 20, 2018, Applicant submitted an online dispute with the stated reason,
“I  have  never  paid  this  account  late.  My  account  balance  is  incorrect.”  (AX  P.)  In  his
Answer, Applicant stated that the credit-card company will not accept any payments on
his behalf. He further stated that he has never been successful in disputing this account
or having it removed from his credit reports but does not believe he owes the money for
this card. Applicant testified that the account has been removed by one of the three major
credit  reporting  agencies.  (Tr.  44.)  He  did  not  provide  any  additional  documentation
regarding this account. This account remains unresolved.
Applicant’s Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  13  letters  of  recommendation  from:  his  current  security
manager  supervisor,  direct  supervisor,  FSO,  five  coworkers,  and  the  IT  director of  the
company  where  Applicant  has  worked  as  a  consultant  since  2016;  and  his  former
supervisor, platoon leader, and two coworkers. Collectively, the letters state that Applicant
is  a  highly  professional  and  trustworthy  individual  and  recommend  him  for  a  security
clearance. Additionally, 12 of the letters state that Applicant “is always very respectful of
privacy, classified information, laws, rules, and regulations.” (AX R.)
While  on  active  duty,  Applicant  received  numerous  medals  and  awards.  He
achieved or exceeded course standards in his service school academic evaluations. (AX
B.) Between 2014 and 2017, he completed multiple cybersecurity certifications. (AX G.)
Applicant received a positive work performance evaluation from his employer in January
2017,  wherein  his  supervisor  stated  that,  Applicant  “has  taken  a  leadership  role  in
documenting new procedures to ensure compliance with new regulatory requirements”
while  quickly  assuming  “all  duties  of  the  information  systems  security  manager  and
alternate facility security officer with no difficulties.”

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  3.a,  3.b,  and  3.c.  He  denied
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  2.a.  He  is  50  years  old.  He  married  in  2000,  divorced  in  2009,  and
remarried  in  2010.  He  has  four  minor  children.  All  are  native-born  U.S.  citizens.  His
eldest child is from a prior relationship. His second child is from his prior marriage. His
youngest two children are from his current marriage.3
Applicant graduated from high school in 1986. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
1990  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2002.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  1990  to  1994,
when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He  has  since  worked  for  various  defense
contractors. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a senior engineer for his current
employer, for whom he has worked since late February 2015. He previously worked for
the  same  company  from  June  2007  to  February  2009.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance in 1990.4
Applicant’s  wife  was  born  in  Russia.  She  is  33  years  old.  She  earned  a
bachelor’s and a master’s degree from a university in Russia in around 2002 and 2009,
respectively.  She  first  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2004.  She  then  returned  to
Russia,  where  she married  her first  spouse,  who  was then  a  Russian  citizen,  in  2005.
Her first spouse is now a U.S. citizen residing in the United States. They immigrated to
the United States in 2005 and divorced in 2007. She remarried a Ukrainian national in
2009 and they lived together in the United States. She then returned to Russia in 2009
for one month to finish her master’s degree, after which time she returned to the United
States. She divorced her second spouse in 2010.5

Applicant’s  wife  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2014.  She  renounced  her
Russian  citizenship  in  2016.  She  has  worked  as  a  business  financial  manager  for  an
engineering  firm  since  May  2015.  The  company’s  partner,  who  is  also  the  facility
security  officer  (FSO),  indicated  that  while  Applicant’s  wife  does  not  need  a  security
clearance, she has received security training like those who do. He described her as a
valued and trusted employee who safeguards the company’s confidential, sensitive, and
proprietary  information.  He  also  indicated  that  she  appears  to  be  a  loyal  American
citizen.6
Applicant’s  parents-in-law  and  brother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Russia. His parents-in-law divorced in 2010. His father-in-law is 60 years old. Applicant
testified that his wife’s father is estranged from the family. She talks to her father several
times yearly, and she has seen him three times between 2008 and 2018. Her father met
her during one of her trips to Russia so that he could meet his grandson. Applicant has
never met or talked to his father-in-law. Applicant is unaware whether his father-in-law is
currently employed, and his wife believes her father is retired. Applicant’s father-in-law
is a former Russian military officer. Applicant testified that his father-in-law served in the
Russian military for several years from around 1983 to 1985, before he was discharged
for stealing rubbing alcohol.7
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  60  years  old.  She  works  as  an  accountant  for  a
brewery.  His  brother-in-law  is  24  years  old.  After  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  graduated
from  college,  he  completed  one  year  of  mandatory  service  in  the  Russian  military  in
around December 2017. He works as a chemist for a private pharmaceutical company.
Applicant  was  unaware  if  his  brother-in-law  had  any  ongoing  affiliations  with  the
Russian  government  or  military.  Applicant’s  wife  video  chats  with  her  mother  once
weekly.  She  is  close  to  her  brother  and  talks  to  him  more  frequently,  at  least  several
times  weekly  and  most  recently  because  of  his  imminent  wedding.  His  mother-in-law
speaks “very little” English and Applicant speaks “very little” Russian, so he simply says
“hello” and ensures that his children do the same on the occasions that his wife talks to
her mother. He has a similar relationship with his brother-in-law.8
Applicant traveled to Russia in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. He followed security
clearance protocol and reported such travels to his FSO. His wife travels to Russia once
yearly, and she stays with her mother during such visits. Though Applicant planned to
travel to Russia with his family to attend his brother-in-law’s wedding and celebrate his
50th birthday, he elected not to do so while his clearance decision was pending. His wife
and two children planned to attend her brother’s wedding in Russia, where they would
stay  in  a  condominium  paid  for  by  her  brother.  His  mother-in-law  and  brother-in-law
have  visited  and  stayed  with  them  in  the  United  States.  They  did  so  before  Applicant
and  his  wife  married,  and  his  mother-in-law  did  so  again  after  the  birth  of  their  son  in

2013  for  six  months.  She  has  attempted  to  revisit  them  since  but  her  visa  has  been
denied at least three times.9
In around 2013, Applicant’s mother-in-law sold her condominium in Russia, and
gave $90,000 of the proceeds to Applicant and his wife, which they used as a deposit
for  their  home  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  reported  this  monetary  gift  to  his  FSO.
They  have  not  received  any  additional  money  and  his  wife  does  not  have  standing  to
inherit any money from anyone in Russia. They do not have any assets, obligations, or
affiliations in Russia. Their assets in the United States total around $1,840,000.10
Applicant’s in-laws in Russia are aware that he works as an engineer. He has not
told them that he holds a security clearance or works on U.S. Government contracts. He
is unaware if his wife has ever disclosed this information to them; she indicated that she
has  not  shared  information  about  Applicant’s  work  or  need  for  a  clearance  to  any
foreign national, to include her mother and brother. Applicant is unaware whether his in-
laws  in  Russia  have  ever  been  approached  by  anyone  in  the  Russian  government  or
military  seeking  information  about  him  or  his  employment.  He  testified  that  he  would
report  to  his  FSO  and  the  proper  authorities  any  attempts  by  anyone  in  Russia  to
blackmail him.11
Applicant  looked  at  pornography  on  his  work  computer  from  around  February
2014  through  February  2015.  At  the  time,  he  had  been  working  for  a  subcontractor
since 2008. He attributed his actions to the “gross miscalculation” he made as a result
of an “extreme amount of stress” from 2013 through 2015. His eldest child was born in
2013  with  a  medical  condition  requiring  multiple  surgeries  through  2015,  as  well  as
continuous  checkups  every  six  months  indefinitely.  He  described  this  experience  as  a
“traumatic” one. In addition, he and his wife “were not in a good spot at all” after she had
disclosed to him that she had multiple affairs between 2013 and 2015.12
Initially,  Applicant  only  looked  at  pornography  at  home.  When  he  became
addicted to it, he also looked at pornography at work. He testified that pornography:
[w]as  my  outlet,  that  was  my  release.  Whether  it  was  five,  ten  minutes,
you know, before work started. Ten, 20, 30 minutes after work . . . before I
went home . . . It relaxed me. It prepared me for going home and having to
work through everything that was going on in the house.
He  also  acknowledged  that  he  looked  at  pornography  at  work  at  lunch  time.  He
estimated that he looked at pornography at work an average of 15 to 30 minutes daily.

He maintained that it never interfered with his work. He did not tell anyone at the time
that he was looking at pornography at work because he knew it was improper.13
In  early  February  2015,  the  primary  defense  contractor removed Applicant  from
the U.S. Government contract to which he had been assigned through his subcontractor
company.  His  program  manager  informed  him  that  computer  monitoring  revealed  that
he had been accessing pornography on his work computer. He immediately reported his
removal and the reason for his removal to his company’s President, Vice President, and
FSO.  He  was  placed  on  administrative  leave  by  his  company  during  the  two-week
period  in  which  the  primary  contractor  conducted  its  investigation,  then  he  was
terminated by his company in around mid-February 2015.14
The investigation conducted by the primary contractor, summarized in an April 2,
2015 letter, consisted of a forensic examination of Applicant’s computer, an interview of
the  contract’s  technical  lead,  and  a  review  of  Applicant’s  time  sheets,  contract
documents,  and  internet  logs.  Applicant  was  never  interviewed.  The  investigation
determined  that  Applicant  viewed  pornography  during  periods  that  were  billed  to  the
U.S.  Government.  As  such,  the  primary  contractor  indicated  that  it  would  issue  to  the
U.S. Government a credit of $21,577.15
Applicant denied that he ever mischarged to the government contract any time in
which he looked at pornography at work. He testified that he was aware that the primary
defense contractor paid $20,000 to the U.S. Government agency in association with his
alleged mischarging; his company repaid the primary contractor $20,000 at the latter’s
request; he was unaware how the amount of $20,000 was quantified; and he was never
asked  to  repay  any  money.  He  acknowledged  during  his  July  2016  background
interview that the $20,000 was restitution for an established 100 hours of computer use
during  work  hours  for  personal  purposes.  A  May  2016  letter  memorializing  a  meeting
between Applicant, his attorney, and debarment officials, reflects that “it was clear that
[Applicant]  has  accepted  responsibility  for  mischarging  a  government  contract  for
misspent time.”16
Applicant  was  placed  under  surveillance  for  one  year  by  his  company’s  ethics
committee from 2016 to 2017. He was required to report his time and his computer was
monitored,  as  further  discussed  below.  He  has  had  no  other  unfavorable  issues.  He
testified  that  it  was  not  easy  for  him  to  stop  looking  at  pornography  at  work.  Once  he
was  terminated  by  his  prior  company,  he  sought  help  for  the  first  time.  He  voluntarily
attended multiple Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) meetings for two  and a half years to
address his addiction. He no longer feels he is addicted to pornography, he intends to
continue  to  attend  SAA  meetings  in  the  future,  and  he  does  not  intend  to  look  at

pornography on his work computer in the future. He eventually disclosed his conduct of
viewing pornography at work and his consequent termination to his wife, who supports
his  SAA  attendance  and  has  herself  attended  such  meetings.  He  handles  stress  by
working out, playing games on his phone, and keeping busy with his family.17
Applicant’s character witness was a vice president for the defense contractor for
whom  they  worked.  He  was  also  Applicant’s  division  director  and  direct  supervisor  of
three  years.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  at  various  occasions  over  a  30-year-
period.  Though  the  witness  was  not  involved  in  rehiring  Applicant,  he  testified  that
Applicant had self-reported his issue with his prior defense contracting company to both
the witness and his predecessor, and despite such knowledge, the predecessor chose
to  rehire  Applicant.  He  testified  that  he  was  aware  that  Applicant  viewed  pornography
on  his  work  computer  during  his  off  hours  while  employed  by  the  prior  defense
contractor;  he  self-reported  his  conduct  to  his  then-employer;  and  Applicant  had  to
leave that company after he was consequently removed from the contract. The witness
testified  that  he  was unaware  that  any  allegations  were  ever  substantiated  concerning
Applicant  mischarging  his  prior  employer  for  time  associated  with  his  pornography
usage at work.18
The  witness  testified  that  he  discussed  the  matter  with  an  individual  from
Applicant’s  prior  employer,  who  described  Applicant’s  conduct  as  a  mistake  and
indicated that Applicant had otherwise been trustworthy. The witness also testified that
he  discussed  the  matter  directly  with  Applicant  and  brought  it  to  the  attention  of  their
employer’s  ethics  committee.  The  committee,  noting  that  Applicant  did  not  have  any
unfavorable  issues  during  his  previous  employment  with  their  company,  placed
Applicant  on  a  one-year  observation  period  beginning  in  around  July  2016,  which
coincided with Applicant’s proposed debarment period.19
During  this  time,  Applicant  reported  his  time  to  the  witness  daily,  his  computer
access  was  monitored,  and  the government  contractor  to  which  he  was  assigned  was
asked  to  provide  any  relevant  observations.  At  the  year’s  conclusion,  the  committee
determined that there was no longer a need for further observation of Applicant and the
proposed  debarment  had  also  ended.  Applicant  continued,  however,  to  report  to  the
witness.  The  witness  has  received  favorable  reports  of  Applicant’s  performance,  and
rated  Applicant  outstanding  in  his  performance  evaluations.  He  testified  that  Applicant
has  complied  with  annual  security  and  ethics  trainings,  and  he  considers  Applicant
trustworthy,  of  good  judgment,  and  capable  of  following  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant’s  FSO  since  2010  described  Applicant  as  an  individual  who  follows  security
rules and procedures. His FSO also indicated that Applicant has completed his annual
security training requirements. 20

Russia
In  2016,  Russia  continued  to  be  a  leading  state  intelligence  threat  to  U.S.
interests.  Its  intelligence  services  target  U.S.  and  allied  personnel  with  access  to
sensitive computer network information. It is assuming a more assertive cyber posture
based on its willingness to target critical infrastructure systems and conduct espionage
operations, even when detected and under increased public scrutiny. It has developed a
ground-launched cruise missile that the United States has declared is in violation of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
Russia  remains  one  of  the  top  two  most  aggressive  and  capable  collectors  of
sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace. Non-
cyberspace collection methods include targeting of U.S. visitors overseas, especially if
the  visitors  are  assessed  as  having  access  to  sensitive  information.  Russia’s  highly
capable  intelligence  services  are  using  human  intelligence  gathering,  cyber,  and  other
operations  to  collect  economic  information  and  technology  to  support  its  economic
development  and  security.  It  continues  to  take  information  warfare  to  a  new  level,
working to fan anti-U.S. and anti-Western sentiment both within Russia and globally.
The  most  significant  human  rights  problems  in  Russia  in  2015  involved
restrictions  on  the  ability  to  choose  one’s  government  and  freedoms  of  expression,
assembly,  association,  and
freedom;  political
the  media,  as  well  as
prosecutions and administration of justice; and government discrimination against racial,
ethnic,  religious,  and  sexual  minorities.  Other  problems  included  allegations  of  torture
and  excessive  force  by  law  enforcement  officials;  executive  branch  pressure  on  the
judiciary; electoral irregularities; and extensive official corruption. The government failed
to take steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses.
internet
Although Russian law prohibits officials from entering a private residence except
in  cases  prescribed  by  federal  law  or  when  authorized  by  a  judicial  decision,
government officials entered residences and premises without warrants. While Russian
law also prohibits government monitoring of correspondence, telephone conversations,
and other means of communication without a warrant, government officials engaged in
electronic surveillance without appropriate authorization.
In October 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Office of
the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI)  issued  a  Joint  Statement  on  Election
Security,  stating  that  the  U.S.  intelligence  community  was  confident  that  the  Russian
government directed recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions,
including from U.S. political organizations. In December 2016, the DHS, ODNI, and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation released a Joint Analysis Report stating that activity by
Russian  intelligence  services  has  been  part  of  a  decade-long  campaign  of  cyber-
enabled  operations  directed  at  the  U.S.  Government  and  its  citizens.  The  campaign
included  spear  phishing;  targeting  of  government  organizations,  critical  infrastructure,
think  tanks,  universities,  political  organizations,  and  corporations;  theft  of  information
from  these  organizations;  and  the  recent  public  release  of  some  of  this  stolen
information.

SOR ¶ 1.a alleges under Guideline M that in 2015, Applicant violated his employer’s
information protection acceptable-use policy by viewing child-pornography images on his
company’s laptop computer. A second allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a asserts that Applicant was
terminated from his employment on August 20, 2015, as a result. SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that
Applicant failed to disclose this derogatory information during an interview on December
19,  2016,  with  an  authorized  investigator  for  DOD.  SOR  ¶  2.c  cross-alleges  the  same
misconduct under SOR ¶ 1.a and raises a concern under Guideline E, personal conduct.
The basis for these allegations is an August 19, 2015 letter of termination from the vice
president of his company (GE 4), and Applicant’s answers to interrogatories dated July 31,
2017, with an attached two-page statement clarifying the summary of his personal subject
interview (PSI) conducted by an authorized investigator on December 19, 2016 (GE 3).
Applicant was terminated from his employment by a previous federal contractor on
August 19, 2015. (Tr. 21) He testified that he was called in by his supervisors in June 2015,
and told that inappropriate images had been found on his work laptop computer. Applicant
admitted he had viewed adult pornography on this laptop. They took his laptop away and
provided him with another loaner laptop. (Tr. 34) Applicant was called in again on August
19,  2015.  He  vehemently  denied  ever  downloading,  accessing,  or  viewing  child
pornography-images on his work laptop computer. (Tr. 45) He did not ever see the offensive

images. He was terminated after 13 ½ years with that employer, and he did not appeal. (Tr.
45)  Applicant  had  taken  computer-security  courses  and  training  and  he  knew  that  the
company prohibited viewing adult pornography on work computers. (Tr. 50, 83)
Applicant  lived  with  his  wife  and  four  children  in  2015.  Local  police  obtained  and
executed a search warrant at his house in March 2016 seeking evidence of a computer
crime. (Tr. 36) Since the internet service provider (ISP) subscription at that address was in
Applicant’s name, he was interviewed first by the police. He vehemently denied viewing or
downloading child-pornography images on his laptop computer. When Applicant’s 17-year-
old stepson was interviewed separately, he admitted downloading the compressed files of
pornographic images of his minor girlfriend on his computer. (Tr. 39, AE A) The stepson
went  to  court  and  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  computer  harassment.  He  was
sentenced to two years of probation and therapy, which he completed, and the conviction
was expunged. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant never gave anybody else his password or computer
access card (CAC) card to access his work laptop computer. (Tr. 43)
In a December 19, 2016, personal subject interview (PSI), a clearance interviewer
went  through  the  various  sections  of  Applicant’s  June  2014  SCA  and  asked  Applicant
questions.  Applicant  told  her  that  he  voluntarily  resigned  from  his  employment  in  2015
because he did not like the contract. (Tr. 56) Applicant testified that this was a snap decision
and he lied to her because he was embarrassed. Applicant wholeheartedly regrets this and
the ensuing falsifications in sections 13 (c) (employment record) and 27 (use of information
technology  systems)  of  the  same  SCA.  (Tr.  57)  Applicant  was  not  forthcoming  with  the
clearance interviewer about derogatory information in his background. Applicant testified
that he viewed adult pornography on his work laptop for three years starting in 2012, and
he last viewed adult pornography in 2015. (Tr. 77, 81)

"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.a.,  and  2.b.  He  denied  SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.a.,  and  3.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 18 line
23  to  page  19  line  9,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense
contractor since “April of” 2017. (GX 1 at page 5.) Applicant was terminated by his prior
employer in September of 2015 for “Policy Violations,” that will be discussed at length,
below.  (GX  3.)  He  served  in  the  Marine  Corp  from  2000~2006,  achieving  the  rank  of
Sergeant. (AppX C at page 3.)
Guideline  M  -  Use  of  Information  Technology,  Guideline  K  -  Handling  Protected
Information & Guideline E - Personal Conduct
1.a.,  2.a.  and  2.b.  Applicant  admits  that  at  his  prior  employment  he  installed
unauthorized software, a Mouse Jiggler,” which prevented his “screen from locking out.”
(TR at page  24  line  23  to page  31  line  6.)  He  avers that  he  was  “unaware  that  it  was
unauthorized,” as he was introduced to it “by a senior administrator that(sic) was acting
as a mentor to . . . [Applicant] at that time.” (Id, and TR at page 84 lines 4~17.) Applicant
has  offered  five  undated  letters  of  support  from  those  he  works  with  at  his  current
employer, but nothing to corroborate averment regarding the unauthorized software.
1.a., and 3.a. Applicant denies that he created five administrated accounts, some
in the names of coworkers, on a classified system without approval. (TR at page 31 line
7 to page 45 line 8, at pages 50 line 15 to page 51 line 3, and at page 55 line 11 to page
68 line 5.) He avers this misconduct was authorized. (TR at page 83 line 25 to page 84
line 3.) However, Applicant has submitted nothing further in support of his averment.
1.a. Applicant denies that he falsified his time card over a seven day period. (TR
at page 45 line 19 to page 50 line 14.) His “Desktop’ was monitored by his employer for
seven of a planned ten days. (AppX A at page 1.) During this period, Applicant “spent”
the  majority  of  his  “Active  Time  on  Non-Work  related  activities  .  .  .  included  doing
homework, browsing online retailers, and watching YouTube videos.” (Id.) I find that this
was a clear misuse of information technology.

"Applicant is a 57-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
in  the  defense  industry.  He  also  held  a  security  clearance  during  previous  military
service.  He  is  employed  as  a  facility  clearance  officer  (FSO)  for  a  company  doing
business in the defense industry. He also has two part-time jobs that are not at issue in
this case.7 His formal education includes two associate’s degrees, a bachelor’s degree
awarded  in  2008,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration  in  2011.  His  first
marriage  ended  in  divorce  in  1990,  and  he  has  been  married  to  his  second  spouse
since 1990. He has eight adult children, none of whom live in his household.
Applicant comes from a military family. His father retired after 30 years of military
service. His wife is a retired servicemember too. Applicant served on active military duty
from  1982  until  he  retired  in  2005.  He  worked  in  the  fields  of  law  enforcement  and
security  services.  He  spent  the  last  five  years  working  in  industrial  information  and
personnel  security  where  he  was  also  responsible  for  protecting  classified  information
and equipment.8 He has a 20% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
He next worked as an FSO for a company during 2005-2011. He also had about eight
months as a self-employed security consultant in 2011. He began his employment as an
FSO and the contract program security office (CPSO) for his previous employer in July
2011. His employment ended in December 2015, the circumstances of which form the
basis for the SOR allegations.

Applicant has an excellent employment record and a good reputation in his line
of  work.  He  presented  substantial  documentary  evidence  establishing  his  honorable
military  service,  his  past  job  performance,  and  training  in  occupational  specialty.9  In
addition, he called eight witnesses all of whom vouched for his overall professionalism,
knowledge of the job, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. In particular, I was
especially impressed by the testimony of a witness who is employed as a special agent
working in the field of industrial security for the Defense Security Services. The witness
described Applicant’s work as a FSO as “very exceptional” with a lot of knowledge and
expertise.10
Turning  to  the  SOR  allegations,  two  matters  are  at  issue  stemming  from  his
employment  as  an  FSO,  which  ended  in  December  2015.  First,  the  SOR  alleges
Applicant  mishandled  company  proprietary  information  in  2015  when  he  transferred
over  1,600  files,  including  company  proprietary  information,  to  a  company-approved
external  hard  drive  without  authorization.  Second,  the  SOR  alleges  that  during  the
course  of  the  2015  investigation  into  the  above  matter,  he  was  asked  to  return  the
external  hard  drive  in  question,  but  intentionally  returned  another  external  hard  drive,
and  he  then  intentionally  and  without  authorization  destroyed  the  external  hard  drive
containing company proprietary information.
Applicant has provided varying accounts of his involvement in the 2015 incident.
In his January 2016 security clearance application, he said he left his job as an FSO in
December  2015  because  he  received  notice  on  November  30,  2015,  that  the  contract
was ending and he resigned on December 18, 2015.11 That is consistent with the layoff
notice  his  employer  provided  with  a  last  day  of  work  scheduled  for  February  5,  2016,
and  Applicant’s  December  3,  2015  letter  of  resignation  with  an  effective  date  of
December 18, 2015.12 He denied leaving the job under adverse circumstances.
But in response to Question 27 of the application, concerning use of information
technology  systems,  he  admitted  in  the  last  seven  years  illegally  or  without
authorization,  modifying,  destroying,  manipulating,  or  denying  others  access  to
information  residing  on  an  information  technology  system  or  attempted  to  do  the
same.13  He  then  provided  the  following  comments  and  explanation  concerning  his
affirmative answer to Question 27:
I  will  attempt  to  explain  my  answer  to  the  question  in  more  detail.  I  had
given  [employer]  my  two  week  notice  for  two  reasons,  one  was  [the]
contract  was  ending  in  February  2016,  and  two  because  I  was  offered

was  cleaning  out  my  files  and  paperwork,  and  also  transferring  some  of
my  accounts  to  other  [company]  employees  who  was  taking  over  my
positions.  On  Dec.  16,  2015,  I  was  asked  by  [employer]  to  turn  over  the
[external] hard drive I was downloading stuff to. I explained that the hard
drive had personal[ly] identifiable information (PII) on it. I turned a different
[external]  hard  drive  that  I  had  in my  possession  and  destroyed  the  hard
drive  that  had  PII  on  it.  I  destroyed  the  hard  drive  that  contained  my
personal  information  because  I  did  not  want  to  provide  my  personal
information

“prescreening  questionnaires”  for  another  program,  and  other  PII  data.
When  asked,  I  explained  that  I  knowingly  provided  my  [employer]  a

[the  external  hard]  drive  that  contained  PII.  I  was  then  informed  that  I
destroyed the hard drive without authorization.14

He  offered  additional  details  about  the  incident  in  response  to  another  question  as
follows:
[I]  destroyed  a  company  [external]  hard  drive [known  as  a] Passport  that
was  issued  to  me  sometime  in  2012.  I  had  personal  information  on  the
hard  drive  including  my  social  security  number  on  documents  and  other
personal items that I did not want to leave behind at the company.15
He further stated that he was relieved of duty with pay on December 16, 2015, and his
last day of work with the company was December 18, 2015.
Applicant  addressed  both  SOR  allegations  in  his  written  answer.  He  formally
denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  explained  that  he  transferred  files  from  a
company-approved  laptop  to  a  company-approved  external  hard  drive,  the  purpose  of
which was to “sanitize” the laptop of PII and other files he had compiled over the course
of four  years of  employment  with  the  company.16  He further explained that  his  actions
were  driven  by  the unusual  circumstance  of  the company  layoff  notice  he  received  on
December 15, 2015.
Concerning the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b, Applicant admitted providing an incorrect
external  hard  drive  and  intentionally  destroyed  the  external  hard  drive  in  question.  He
explained  that  he  was  acting  in  good  faith  to  ensure  that  he  did  not  improperly  or
inadvertently  release  PII,  such  as  social  security  numbers,  addresses,  identifications,
etc.  He  denied  knowing  if  any  company  proprietary  information  was  on  the  destroyed

hard drive, but said any such information was certainly backed-up on the shared drive at
work and easily accessible in that way.
In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  described  the  events  leading  up  to  his
decision to accept a new job and give two weeks’ notice to his then employer. He then
explained that he was confronted by a company official about downloading information
during a telephone call setup as a debriefing.17 He denied downloading information to a
personal  hard  drive  or  personal  USB  drives.18  He  also  denied  downloading  any
proprietary information.19 The call ended that day on December 16, and Applicant went
to  another location  to assist  the  work  there. While  there  he  received another  call from
the company to inform him that he was relieved from duty, and he was instructed to turn
over  his  company-owned  property  (e.g.,  badge,  keys,  laptop,  etc.).20  He  did  as
instructed and then got into his car and went home.
Applicant  destroyed  a  company-owned  external  hard  drive  (Passport  #1)  after
arriving home.21 He explained that he dismantled it with tools, put the parts in his grill,
and burned the parts with the assistance of lighter fluid. He explained that Passport #1
ended up at his home because he routinely carried it in a bag due to its sensitivity, and
the  bag  was  in  his  car  when  he  went  home  that  day.  He  agreed  that  Passport  #1
contained  sensitive  but  unclassified  information.  He  stated  that  as  far  as  he  knew
Passport #1 did not contain any company proprietary information. He stated that it did
not occur to him to turn in Passport #1 with the other equipment at the worksite because
he was surprised and in shock about being relieved from duty. Upon arriving home, he
realized  he  had  Passport  #1  and  was  concerned  about  it.  Knowing  Passport  #1
contained PII associated with other people, he decided to destroy the device. It did not
occur  to  him  at  the  time  to  call  his  supervisor  at  work  and  inform  them  about  his
possession  of  Passport  #1.  He  thinks  he  may  have  called  someone  at  work
subsequently  and  was  unable  to  talk  with  anyone,  but  he  does  not  remember  with
certainty.
The investigation by Applicant’s former employer substantiated the allegations of
damage  to  the  company’s  assets  and  unauthorized  downloads.22  Applicant  along  with
the  other  employees  who  received  layoff  notices  at  the  end  of  November  2015  were
placed  on  elevated  computer  and  e-mail  monitoring.  In  addition,  a  90-day  retroactive
download  report  was  generated  that  showed  Applicant  had  conducted  multiple
downloads  to  a  “possible  personal  external device,” since  September  2015,  with  more

than 1,600 files being moved, to include presumed personal files and company files that
likely  contained  company  proprietary
forms,

(e.g.,  security-related
information
Company  investigators  interviewed  Applicant  on  Wednesday,  December  16,
2015, which was a couple of days before Applicant’s final day of work on December 18.
Applicant  admitted  using  the  external  hard  drive  for  work-related  matters  but  not  for
personal  use.  When  confronted  that  computer  data  showed  that  personal  information
was  on  the  device,  Applicant  stated  he  did  not  know  what  they  were  talking  about.
Applicant  stated  that  it  was  a  company-purchased  device  that  was  given  to  him  by
another employee. He also stated that he used the device for work-related tasks while
at  the  site  or  on  business  travel  and  had  done  so  for  the  last  three  years.  Applicant
indicated that he would turn over the device to his manager before his departure from
the  company.  He  further  stated  that  he  did  not  have  any  classified  or  proprietary
information in his possession.
After  the  interview,  Applicant  was  placed  on  paid  administrative  leave  for  the
remaining  two  days  of  his  two-week-notice  period.  Applicant  turned  over  all  assigned
company  assets  to  security,  and Passport  #2  was  turned  over  to  the  site manager for
review.
The  company  determined  that  the  external  hard  drive  was  only  used  with
Applicant’s company-issued laptop. They also determined that the contents of Passport
#2 were different from the files displayed in the screenshots and it was not the device
Applicant used for downloads and during the monitoring period.
Applicant  was  contacted  again  concerning  Passport  #1.  He  stated  that  he  had
two  Passports  while  at  work,  but  he  withheld  this  information,  although  he  knew  the
company  investigator  wanted  to  obtain  Passport  #1.  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not
want  anyone  having  access  to  his  personal  information  on  Passport  #1.  He  further
stated that he brought Passport #1 to his home and destroyed it even though he knew
the  device  was  company  property  and  should  have  been  returned  to  the  company  for
review.  He  described  how  he  destroyed  the  device  by  dismantling  it  and  burning  the
parts  in  his  grill.  He  further  stated  that  he  did  not  have  any  classified  or  property
information in his possession, and he apologized for deceiving the company investigator
during the interview. The memorandum ends by noting that Applicant resigned in lieu of
termination on December 18, 2015.
Based on the matters set forth above, I hereby make the specific findings of fact:
1.  Applicant  mishandled  company  proprietary  information  in  2015  by
transferring  or  downloading  more  than  1,600  files,  including  company
propriety  information,  to  a  company-approved  external  hard  drive
(Passport #1) without authorization.
2.  Applicant  was  asked  to  return  the  external  hard  drive  (Passport  #1)
containing  the  company  proprietary  information  during  the  2015
company  investigation,  but  he  instead  returned  another  external  hard
drive (Passport #2) while at the same time retaining and destroying the
sought-after  device  (Passport  #1).  Destruction  of  the  device  was
intentional and without authorization from his then employer.

This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.23
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.24  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”25  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.26 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.27
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.28  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.29
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.30  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting

evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.31  An
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.32  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.33
Discussion
Although  the  SOR  alleges  three  different  security  guidelines,  Guidelines  K,  M,
and  E,  they  rely  on  the  same  set  of  facts  and  circumstances  as  set  forth  in  the  initial
paragraphs of the SOR at ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Given these circumstances, these matters will
be  addressed  together,  because  the  overall  decision  is  an  evaluation  of  Applicant’s
trustworthiness,  judgment,  reliability,  and  willingness  and  ability  to  safeguard  protect
classified or sensitive information, which are central matters for consideration under all
three security guidelines.
Under  Guidelines  K,  M,  and  E,  I  have  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions  as  most  pertinent  to  the facts and  circumstances  of  this  case:  AG  ¶¶  34(b)
and (g), AG ¶¶ 40(b) and (d), and AG ¶ 17(c). Likewise, under Guidelines K, M, and E, I
have  considered  the  following  mitigating  conditions  as  most  pertinent  to  the  facts  and
circumstances of this case: AG ¶ 35(a), AG ¶ 41(a), and AG ¶ 17(c). Having considered
the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances  in  light  of  the  pertinent  disqualifying  and
mitigating  conditions,  I  conclude  that  Applicant  did  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  to
mitigate the security concerns stemming from his intentional destruction of a company-
owned  external  hard  drive  to  which  he  had  transferred  or  moved  approximately  1,600
files, which included company propriety information, from his company-owned laptop in
advance  of  beginning  another  job  in  the  defense  industry.  The  sheer  number  of
downloaded files, reported to be more than 1,600, supports a conclusion Applicant was
transferring more than personal files.
My  main  concerns  and  doubts  in  this  case  are  twofold.  First,  Applicant  gave
varying  accounts  of  his  involvement  in  the  2015  incident.  Taken  as  a  whole,  his
accounts are at variance in important respects with his former employer’s account of the
2015  investigation  as  set  forth  in  the  January  2018  memorandum.  For  example,
according  to  the  January  2018  memorandum,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  purposely
provided  Passport  #2  instead  of  Passport  #1  to  company  officials.  He  said  essentially
the  same  thing  in  his  January  2016  security  clearance  application,  as  quoted  in  the
findings of fact. But in his hearing testimony he attributed his retention of Passport #1 to
oversight during the unexpected circumstance of being relieved from duty on December
31 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14.
32 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
33 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
16.  Given  the  varying  accounts,  I  am  uncertain  if  Applicant  is  giving  full,  frank,  and
truthful answers about his involvement in this matter.34
Second, Applicant did not conduct himself as an honest person on December 16
knowing that he still had Passport #1. An honest person would have made a reasonable
effort  to  return  Passport  #1  to  his  employer.  Return  of  the  device  could  have  been
accomplished  by  a  telephone  call  or  e-mail  to  his  supervisor  or  some  other  company
official;  getting  in  the  car  and  returning  the  device  to  his  employer’s  worksite;  or  by
mailing  or  delivery  of  the  device  to  the  employer  along  with  an  explanatory  note.
Applicant thinks he may have made a phone call without success, but his recollection is
uncertain. Further, an honest person would not have rushed to destroy Passport #1 on
the  same  day  he  was  placed  on  administrative  leave,  knowing  that  it  was  likely  the
company would be looking for it. Other than a single phone call, he did none of things
an  honest  person  would  have  done  if  they  had  inadvertently  or  mistakenly  retained
Passport #1. Instead, Applicant destroyed Passport #1 by dismantling it with tools and
burning the parts in his grill. Such conduct is suspicious and suggests he was trying to
hide  or  conceal  adverse  information.  Given  these  circumstances,  I  view  Applicant’s
transgressions as reflected herein to be serious misconduct.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  In  doing  so,  I
considered Applicant’s 23-plus years of honorable military service, his years of holding
a  security  clearance  in  the  military  and  while  working  in  the  defense  industry,  his
excellent  employment  record,  his  formal  education,  his  wealth  of  training  in  his
occupational  speciality,  and  the  highly  favorable  testimony  of  the  eight  witnesses.
Nevertheless,  his  favorable  evidence  does  not  outweigh  the  seriousness  of  his
misconduct.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  that  he  did  not  meet  his  ultimate  burden  of
persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him
eligibility for access to classified information.

"Applicant is a 63-year-old contracts manager for a defense contractor, employed
since 2014. He previously worked for another defense contractor from 2009 until he was
laid off in 2013. Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in 1980. He married in 1982 and
has two adult children. He held a DOD security clearance for 30 years before he was laid
off in 2013.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  E  that  Applicant  copied  company  proprietary
files  after  being  notified  that  he  was  selected  for  layoff.  When  confronted,  he  denied
having the files, until he admitted copying them after repeated questioning. Applicant also
falsified  material  facts  presented  to  a  Government  investigator  regarding  this  incident.
The incident described in SOR ¶ 1.a is cross-alleged under Guidelines K and M. In his
Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally copying the 661 files, and that it was
not his intent to do so. Rather, he intended to copy examples of his work for use in finding
another job, as he was in a “panic mode.” He noted that he had permission to work from
home  and  that  the  Government  investigator  was  “misleading.”  The  Government’s
evidence is sufficient to establish the SOR allegations.
On August 1, 2013, Applicant was notified that he was selected for layoff. He was
notified not to have contact with company customers during the transition. The company
began to monitor his work computer. Subsequently, Applicant removed three boxes from
the office and composed an email to the contracts team and copied the customer. On
Sunday, August 4, 2013, Applicant accessed the company computer system remotely,
deleted  certain  data  and  copied  661  files  to  his  personal  thumb  drive.  The  files  were
contract  related  information,  including  sensitive  company  financial  information  and
proprietary information including contracts, contract negotiation information, and attorney
work-product.
On August 8, 2013, Applicant met with company human resources and security
personnel.  He  signed  several  statements  affirming  that  he  was  not  in  possession  of
company proprietary information and electronic media. He was asked three times if he
had any company data in his possession, and Applicant denied it each time. The fourth
time, he admitted he may have information he copied for the transition. When the list of
661  files  was  presented  to  him,  he  admitted  he  had  copied  the  files  for  “reference”
purposes. He returned the thumb drive as directed.
When  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  2015,  Applicant  claimed  he
copied files with his supervisor’s permission over a period of time to a company thumb
drive and he was unaware of making any false statements to company personnel.
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he generally denied any wrongdoing with regard
to copying documents, and claimed the Government investigator was “misleading.” He
stated that he was focused on getting his job done, and when he lost use of a company
issued thumb drive, he used his personal thumb drive, and he did not remember that until
he was confronted with specifics. He apologized for his actions and stated that “what I did
after I lost my job was really stupid, and the only excuse I can offer is my state of mind at
the time.”
During the hearing in this case, Applicant admitted that he did things he should not
have,  including  taking  company  documents  that  were  useful  to  his  new  job  and  was
deceptive to the company. However, Applicant also testified that the he did not take files
for  an  improper  purpose  and  denied  having  company  proprietary  information.  When
questioned,  he  admitted  having  company
foreign  contracts  and  attorney-client
information. He also stated that he forgot the thumb drive was in his possession when
confronted by the company, and claimed that he copied documents routinely as part of
his work, but could not remember if he had a company laptop or a way to connect to the
company  computer  system  when  away  from  work.  He  has  not  sought  counseling  to
address this issue.

"Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  system  administrator,  senior  software  engineer,  and
information  systems  security  officer  for  a  defense  contractor,  employed  since  2008.
Applicant married in 1980 and has two adult children. He received a bachelor’s degree in
1991.  He  testified  that  he  has  held  a  DOD  top  secret  security  clearance  for  nearly  30
years.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  K  (Handling  Protected  Information),  that
Applicant  committed  security  violations  in  2015  by  not  properly  securing  classified
information;  and  in  2016  by  improperly  using  his  system  administrator  logins  and
passwords, in violation of his privileged user agreement. The SOR also alleges that in
2017,  his  employer  relieved  him  of  his  information  system  security  officer  and  system
administrator duties  and access  to  system accounts following  several inspection  items
from  2016  to  2017  that  showed  repeated  failures  to  comply  with  system  security
requirements, policies, and procedures. The incidents described in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c
were cross-alleged under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology). In his Answer to
the SOR, Applicant  admitted the two incidents  in 2015 and 2016, but denied the 2017
allegation  and  the  cross-allegation  under  Guideline  M.  The  Government’s  evidence  is
sufficient to establish the SOR allegations.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  failed  to  properly  secure  classified  information.
Applicant was appointed the information systems security officer (ISSO) by his employer
in January 2015 after the previous ISSO retired. Applicant was not fully familiar with his
duties and responsibilities, and relied on the security team supporting him, “on the job
training,”  and  the  supervision  of  the  information  systems  security  manager  (ISSM).
Historical audit computer logs were backed up on rewritable compact discs (CD) that were
marked  with  the  appropriate  security  classification,  since  the  information  was  being
written from a classified system. The CDs were kept in plastic sleeves in a portfolio binder,
marked  with  classification  markings,  and  secured.  Applicant’s  assistant  ISSO  (AISSO)
was required to create the CDs for a historical record, until the company transferred all of
the logs to external hard drives. The CDs were phased out, and another new AISSO was
tasked to ensure the destruction of the old CDs. Applicant and his assistant emptied all
of the CDs from their plastic sleeves in the binder, and sent the “empty” portfolio binder
to a supply room to be reused. The supply room was in an access-controlled area, but
not a classified controlled area. The binder was later discovered by an employee with one
CD still in a sleeve. Applicant claims the CD did not have any classified information on it,
but it was marked “classified” because the data came from a classified computer system.
Applicant was cited for a security violation, but there was no evidence of loss, compromise
or suspected compromise of classified information found. Applicant took responsibility for
the mistake, was given remedial training, and never repeated this security violation again.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant improperly used his system administrator logins and
passwords,  and failed  to follow  user privileges  and  information  assurance  procedures.
Shortly after assuming the ISSO position, Applicant was tasked to work on an information
system (IS) with which he was previously unfamiliar. He was read into the program, and
entered the particular lab in 2015, where he first saw a completely assembled IS system.
He noted that the IS had not been certified, however it was already located in a special
secured area. Applicant was tasked to certify it by the security official for the program. At
the  time,  common  practice  was  to  allow  the  ISSO  to  log  into  the  system  using  root
credentials, but that practice was later stopped. Applicant met with the security staff for
the  program  and  explained  what  he  needed  to  do  to  certify  the  IS,  and  Applicant
requested  that  the  security  department  permit  another  system  administrator  (SA)  who
developed the IS, to assist him. The SA was briefed by the program security officer and
permitted  to  enter  the  space.  Applicant  later  learned  that  the  security  official  was  not
authorized to give the SA both a general user and a privileged user briefing at once. One
of the briefings should have been done by another security office within the company, but
Applicant noted it was often done by the same person. According to Applicant, once the
oversight was discovered, the SA received the proper authorization “within five minutes,”
and believed his actions were authorized and the most efficient method to accomplish the
task.
Applicant  was  also  alleged  to have  continued  to  use the  root account for logins
after the system had been certified, and that he failed to document the logins using the
root account for tracking and auditing purposes. Applicant explained that using the root
credentials  was  the  only  way  to  solve  the  problems  with  the  IS,  and  that  the  security
department should have made logs available to be used to document occasions where
the root certification was used. However, Applicant took responsibility for not logging the
uses properly, and testified that logins were in fact traceable, even without the logs. As a
result  of  the  security  violation,  Applicant  was  denied  access  to  particular  programs
operated  by  that  military  branch.  No  evidence  of  loss,  compromise,  or  suspected
compromise of classified information was found.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant was relieved of his ISSO duties and access to
secure areas in October 2017, after self-inspections disclosed repeated failures to comply
with the information system configuration and operational security requirements, policies,
and procedures. In particular, the Government’s evidence shows various non-compliance
issues with users on the system, user briefings, seal logs, incomplete permissions and
auditing settings, poor maintenance log retention, laptop CD/DVD drive and removable
media  controls  not  configured  properly,  and  no  system  warning  banner  displayed.  In
addition, Applicant did not correct the deficiencies within the two-week period provided.
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  responsible  for  keeping  track  of  200  user
authorizations  for  18  systems.  There  were  discussions  and  changes  to  the  user
authorization procedures and forms during this period, and that the system in question
was housed at a military base under a mobile deployment plan to allow it to be operated
in the field. At the same time the system was returned to Applicant’s facility for audits,
patching,  and  updates  after  a  longer-than-usual  period  outside  the  facility,  a  self-
inspection was conducted. Applicant supported the self-inspection and was interested in
seeing the results so that he could make the corrections and return the system back to
the field. Applicant argued that the ISSM agreed with the field engineers to permit them
to  create  user  accounts  and  were  responsible  for  the  system  while  it  was  outside
Applicant’s facility. Applicant did not have physical access to the system or oversight while
it was in the field, and the engineers improperly created new user accounts for personnel
that needed access while the system was deployed.
Applicant  sent  his  ASSOs  to  the  meeting  to  discuss  the  self-inspection  findings
because  of  a  conflict,  and  later  learned  that  his  ASSOs  did  not  make  the  simple
corrections to fix the deficiencies. Applicant’s access was denied before he could inspect
the  system  on  his  own,  and  was  not  fully  apprised  of  the  deficiencies  after  the  self-
inspection. After being denied access, Applicant spent the next two weeks instructing his
ASSOs on how to correct the deficiencies. Applicant admits he should have been more
forceful  in  demanding  the  list  of  findings  of  the  self-inspection  and  more  proactive  in
addressing the problems, but relied on others to do the work. Applicant agrees that he
was responsible for supervising his ASSOs in completing the work required, but notes
that security rules changed after the system was certified for deployment. He disagreed
with  some  of  the  findings  regarding  hard  drives,  and  asserted  that  the  ISSM  shared
responsibility for the system, certified it for mobile deployment, and should have worked
with him to correct deficiencies once they were discovered, rather than deny him access.
He  also  acknowledged  that  he  was  aware  of  one  previous  user  agreement  deficiency
before  the  2017  findings,  but  not  the  other  previous  deficiencies  noted  in  the  self-
inspection  report.  No  compromise  of  classified  information  or  counter-intelligence
implications were found as a result of the incidents discussed above.
Applicant emphatically denies any intention to violate security rules or procedures
during any of the incidents listed in the SOR. He had never had a security violation in the
past, despite nearly 30 years with a top secret security clearance. He believes the large
volume  of  work  and  poor  training  and  directions  from  his  manager  led  to  the  eventual
security violations. Applicant submitted a detailed narrative response to the allegations,
a 2016 security training certification, a certificate of recognition from his company,  and
other  documents  in  support  of  his  testimony.  His  testimony  was  comprehensive,
straightforward, and sincere, while always maintaining his professionalism.
Applicant’s former information systems security risk manager and former ISSM at
the company provided a signed, sworn statement of support for Applicant, and claimed
that three unnamed employees within the information security office targeted Applicant
and other employees to interpret the rules to find security infractions in order to cause
them to lose their security clearance and job. He noted that once an infraction was found,
the  employee  had  very  little  recourse  in  defense.  He  also  noted  that  Applicant  was
trustworthy,  and  called  him  an  asset  to  the  community  that  cares  about  protecting
classified information and a proud supporter of the warfighter. No corroborating evidence
of  inappropriate  behavior  of  security  personnel  at  the  company  was  presented  at  the
hearing, but Applicant quoted the writer’s claim in his Answer to the SOR.
Another coworker attested to Applicant’s good judgment, stating he would never
knowingly  violate  security  regulations  or  procedures,  and  noted  Applicant  was
conscientious, stable, caring, and trustworthy. A director of security for another defense
contractor who has known Applicant since 1987 when they were friends and coworkers,
wrote of Applicant’s “great integrity.” A current engineer at Applicant’s company wrote of
Applicant’s  reliability,  good  judgment,  stability,  and  responsibility.  He  notes  situations
where  Applicant  steadfastly  followed  security  rules  to  maintain  security  compliance
regardless of user complaints or inconvenience.
",True
"Applicant  is  51  years  old  and  is  being  sponsored  for  a  security  clearance  by  a
defense contractor. He is married and has a doctorate degree. Applicant owns his own
company, but used to be employed by Company A.
Paragraph 1 (Guideline M, Use of Information Technology)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  because  he  failed  to  comply  with  rules,
procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to information technology systems.
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security eligibility and a security clearance because he engaged in conduct that involved
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations, thereby raising questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability
to protect classified or sensitive information.
Both allegations in this case refer to a single act by Applicant in the days before
he  was  terminated  from  his  employment  with  Company  A.  Applicant  was  hired  by
Company  A  in  June 2009  to fill a  senior  management  position  related  to  his particular
area of expertise. He is an acknowledged expert in his field, which is limited to a very
small  number  of  people  and  companies.  Company  A  expected  Applicant  to  help  grow
their business in this field, which he did for several years. (Tr. 27-28.)
Beginning  in  2014,  the  relationship  between  Applicant  and  the  leadership  of
Company A began to sour. Applicant approached the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of
Company A and alleged that another senior manager was actively defrauding the Federal
government. The CEO said that he would look into it but, according to Applicant, instead
the CEO set about making Applicant’s continued employment at Company A untenable.
(Answer; Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 28, 75-76.)
The situation came to a head in early June 2015. On June 3, 2015, a coworker
and friend of Applicant, Mr. E, was let go by Company A. Whether Mr. E actively resigned,
his  threat  to  resign  was  accepted,  or  he  was  terminated,  is  of  little  significance  to  the
Applicant’s  national  security  eligibility.  In  any  event,  Mr.  E’s  departure  convinced
Applicant he could no longer work for Company A. (Answer; Applicant Exhibits A and F;
Tr. 82-84.)
On  June  4,  2015,  before  normal  work  hours,  Applicant  arrived  at  his  office.
According to Applicant he often did this. That morning Applicant printed out a copy of his
Outlook contacts from Company A’s computer system. Included in the Outlook file were
contacts that Applicant had before his employment, as well as those he acquired after he
began employment, which included employees of Company A. Applicant stated that he
printed out the Outlook file so that he could go through it and separate out those contacts
that he had prior to employment with Company A, which the company had wanted him to
do for some time. (Applicant Exhibit F at Attachment 2; Tr. 59-61, 71-74.)
Applicant stated that later in the morning of June 4, 2015, he had a discussion with
the CEO, during which Applicant berated the CEO for Company A’s conduct towards Mr.
E, and informed the CEO that he wished to leave his employment with Company A in the
near future.  He  then  left  his place  of  employment  with  a  folder  containing  the  Outlook
printout.  At  this  point,  it  is  important  to  note,  all  parties  agree  that  Applicant  had  not
resigned  or  been  terminated.  (Answer;  Government  Exhibit  2;  Applicant  Exhibit  F  at
Attachment 5; Tr. 28-29, 61-63, 75, 85-86.)
Company  A  wrote  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  a  letter  dated  May  25,
2017, which concerned Applicant’s conduct. That letter stated:
On June 4, 2015 [Company A’s] Information Technology Department  (IT)
observed [Applicant] accessing and printing out [Company A’s] proprietary
customer data as well as [Company A] contact information. There was no
legitimate  business  reason  for  this  action  and  it  occurred  early  in  the
morning (between 6:47 am and 6:50 am) when, by [Applicant’s] own words,
he was “not on the clock.” (Government Exhibit 3 at 1.)
Based  on  the  above-described  conduct,  according  to  Company  A,  the  decision
was  made  to  terminate  Applicant  for  cause  for  violating  the  terms  of  his  employment
contract. Applicant was informed of this fact in an email dated June 6, 2015. There is no
allegation  or  evidence  that  Applicant  took  any  other  type  of  proprietary  information.
(Government Exhibit 3; Applicant Exhibit F at Attachment 5.)
Company A subsequently sent a letter to Applicant dated June 11, 2015. In that
letter Company A advised Applicant that they believed his conduct in printing the Outlook
contacts file violated his employment agreement. In addition, and more pertinent to this
decision, Company A felt that Applicant’s conduct violated their “Proprietary Information
and Assignment of Inventions Agreement” (PIAIA). (Government Exhibit 3.)
The PIAIA states in pertinent part that Applicant agrees:
1.1.  Recognition  of  Company’s Rights:  Nondisclosure. At all  times during
my employment and thereafter I will hold in strictest confidence and will not
disclose, use . . . any of the Company’s . . . Proprietary Information . . . ,
except as such disclosure, use . . . may be required in connection with my
work for the Company. . .
1.2. Proprietary Information. The term “Proprietary Information” shall mean
any and all confidential and/or proprietary knowledge, data, or information
of  the  Company.  .  .  By  way  of  illustration  but  not  limitation,  “Proprietary
Information”  includes  .  .  .  (b)  customer/prospective  customer  information,
customer/client  lists  and  all  lists  or  other  compilations  containing  client,
customer  or  vendor  information.  .  .  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  it  is
understood that, at all such times, I am free to use information which is or
becomes publicly known through lawful means, which was rightfully in my
possession or part of my general knowledge prior to my employment with
the Company as specifically identified and disclosed by me in Exhibit A-2,
or which is disclosed to me without confidence or proprietary restriction by
a third party who rightfully possesses the information (without confidential
or  proprietary  restriction)  and  who  did  not  learn  of  it  directly  from  the
Company. (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant argued that Company A’s statement that he stole proprietary information
in printing up the Outlook contacts list was a determination made after the fact to justify
his termination. According to Applicant, Company A used his action as a subterfuge in
order  not  to  pay  a  substantial  amount  of  money  upon  his  leaving  the  company.  He
maintained  that  his  conduct  was  appropriate,  innocuous  and  within  the  scope  of  his
employment at the time. He admitted that he wanted to separate out his contacts from
the company’s because he knew he was going to leave the company soon, not because
he thought he would be terminated. Applicant did not believe that the Outlook contacts
list  was  proprietary  data.  At  that  time  Applicant  also  had  a  cell  phone  provided  by
Company A that also contained the same Outlook contacts file. (Tr. 32-33, 57-58, 68-69,
71-74, 84-87.)
Within  a  week  or  so  after  leaving  employment  Applicant  returned  the  Outlook
contacts  list  to  Company  A’s  representative.  (Answer  at  Exhibit  7  of  Attachment  1;
Applicant Exhibit F at Attachment 9; Tr. 67.)
Applicant soon became involved in litigation with Company A over his termination.
That litigation was extensive and acrimonious. It eventually lead to an agreement between
the parties in which Applicant received a monetary settlement. Applicant maintained that
this litigation, along with other actions by Company A, were designed to prevent Applicant
from  working  in  the  defense  industry.  Applicant  submitted  documents,  pleadings  and
transcripts concerning this litigation. The statements made in these documents are given
appropriate weight in this decision. (Answer at Attachments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9;
Applicant Exhibits A, B, D, E, and F at Attachments 1, 7, and 8; Tr. 29-30.)
Mitigation
Applicant was a valued member of Company A until the time of his termination, as
shown  by  his  performance  appraisal  dated  October  2014.  (Answer  at  Exhibit  3  of
Attachment 1.)
Applicant provided letters of recommendation from people who know him in the
defense industry.  He is described as a man of character, a person who is trustworthy,
and  a  valued  professional.  They  all  recommend  him  for  a  position  of  trust.  (Applicant
Exhibits C, G, and H.)

"Applicant,  60,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  Company  A,  a  federal
contracting  company,  since  March  2016.  He  worked  for  his  previous  employer,
Company  B,  another  federal  contracting  company,  for  31  years  from  1988  until
February  2016  when  he  was  ordered  to  resign  in  lieu  of  termination.  On  February  23,
2016,  Company  B  filed  an  adverse  information  report  in  the  Joint  Adjudication
Personnel  System  (JPAS),  alerting  the  DOD  CAF  that  Applicant  attempted  to  retain
Company  B  propriety  information  related  to his employment  without  authorization,  and
that  he  made  deliberately  false  statements  to  a  Company  B  investigator.  Applicant
completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  August  2016,  disclosing  that  he  was
disciplined by Company B for having “backup disks that contained company proprietary
information.”  He  disclosed  that  after  resigning  and  providing  two-weeks’  notice,  that
Company  B  released him  two  days  early,  informing  him by  letter after the fact  that  he
resigned  in  lieu  of  termination.  According  to  the  August  2016  security  clearance
application, the DOD granted Applicant security clearance eligibility in 2013. It is unclear
from the record if he held security clearance eligibility before 2013. (AE 4-5.)
In February 2016, Applicant accepted an offer of employment from Company A.
He  tendered  his  resignation  to  Company  B  on  February  18,  2016.  Following  internal
protocol,  the  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  informed  Company  B’s  counterintelligence
group that Applicant was going to work for a competitor, Company A, in a position in the
same technology area. After determining that Applicant had critical intellectual property
knowledge and access, the counterintelligence group performed a due-diligence review
to identify the movement of any Company B data to external media or non-Company B
email addresses. The review revealed that Applicant transferred over 93,000 Company
B files, including 25,000 related to a project that Applicant worked on between 1994 and
2013,  to  two  personal  storage  devices.  While  it  is  unclear  when  Applicant  started
transferring  these  files,  Company  B  noted  that  48,600  of  the  files  were  transferred
between  January  and February  2016.  The downloaded  information  included  Company
B  proprietary
foreign  military
information,  and  sensitive,  unclassified  DOD  program  information.  Company  B
determined that use or disclosure of the information by Applicant could cause potential
loss of competitive advantage to Company B and could cause potential damage to U.S.
interests. (GE 5-6, 10-11.)
technical  and  business-related,
information,  both
On February 19, 2016, a Company B counterintelligence investigator interviewed
Applicant.  The  FSO  and  a  human  resources  representative  were  also  present  for  the
interview.  At  the  beginning  of  the  interview,  the  investigator  had  Applicant  review
Company B’s policy regarding the ownership and protection of proprietary information,
as well as Company’s B policy on internal investigations. According to the investigative
report,  Applicant  signed  an  acknowledgement  certifying  that  he  did  not  retain  any
Company  B  proprietary  information.  During  the  interview,  Applicant  repeatedly  denied
transferring Company B data to personal devices, even when asked about the specific
devices he used. He admitted transferring the files only after the investigator confronted
him  with  direct evidence.  He  explained  that the  downloaded files  represented his life’s
work  and  that  he  wanted  to  have  it  available  to  him  in  his  role  at  Company  A  for
personal reference only. (GE 7-10.)
At  Company  B’s  direction,  Applicant  retrieved  the  two  storage  devices  from  his
home  and  surrendered  them  for  examination.  He  was  then  placed  on  administrative
leave  pending  a  forensic  review  of  the  devices  and  a  decision  from  management  on
how  to  handle  the  situation.  A  forensic  review  of  the  devices  revealed  that  Applicant
transferred over 200,000 files, the majority of which belonged to Company B, including
over 25,000 related to a specific program. The forensic review also seemed to suggest
Applicant was transferring data to personal devices as early as 2012. (GE 7-10.)
The  investigation  confirmed  that  Applicant  transferred  Company  B  proprietary
and sensitive data to personal devices in violation of the company’s IT policy regarding
the introduction  and storage of Company B data on unauthorized devices. On February
24, 2016, Company B issued Applicant an order requiring his immediate resignation in
lieu  of  termination.  Company  B  also  sent  a  letter  to  Company  A  informing  them  of
Applicant’s actions and to place Company A on notice not to make use of any Company
B proprietary information provided to them by Applicant. Company B referred the matter
to  the  FBI  for  further  investigation.  The  FBI  referred  the  case  to  the  U.S.  Attorney’s
Office,  seeking  a  warrant  to  search  Applicant’s  home  for  additional  materials  and  for
prosecution under 18 U.S.C. ¶ 1832, “Theft of Trade Secrets.” The U.S. Attorney’s office
declined to pursue the case. (GE 10-11.)
Applicant  admits  he  lied  during  the  Company  B  interview,  but  denies  he
downloaded  the  files  for  any  nefarious  purposes.  In  his  response  to  the  FORM,
Applicant explained that he began blindly backing up all of his professional files in 2000
to preserve the work he generated for his personal use. He lied during the Company B
interview  because  he  was  scared.  Applicant  considers  himself  an  honest  person  who
exhibited  extremely  poor  judgment  in  violating  Company  B’s  policies.  He  vows  not  to
violate his employer’s rules in the future. (GE 3-4; AE A.)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
He has been employed with the defense contractor since November of 2016. (GX 1 at
page  15.)  As  a  result  of  the  incident  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.a.,  Applicant  “was
denied  access  to  classified  information,”  but  it  was  re-granted  in  conjunction  with  his
current duty position. (GX 1 at pages 91~92.). He is divorced, and has no children. (TR
at page 12 line 21 to page 15 line 14.)
Guideline M - Use of Information Technology & Guideline E - Personal Conduct
1.a.  and  2.a    Applicant,  while  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  intentionally
misused his administrative rights access to a U.S. Government administrative computer
account to log into his then wife’s personal storage files, on two to three occasions, from
about December of 2015 to February of 2016. He suspected that she was engaging in
on-line  infidelity.  (TR  at  page  36  line  2  to  page  42  line  12,  and  at  page  52  line  12  to
page  55  line  7,  and  AppX  K.)  Applicant  self-reported  this error  in  judgment.  (Id.)  This,
coupled with an October 2, 2015, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) incident,
which  will  be  discussed  under  Paragraph  3,  below,  resulted  in  Applicant  being
separated  from  the  Air  Force.  (TR  at  page  17  line  12  to  page  21  line  7.)  His  former
spouse,  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  supports  Applicant’s  security  clearance
retention request. (AppX O.)
Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption
3.a.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  cited  in  1999  for  possession  of  alcohol  by  a
minor. (Answer2 at page 1.)
3.b.  Applicant  admits  that  in  August  of  2005,  he  was  charged  with  a  DUI.  The
charges  were  later  dismissed  in  accordance  with  a  plea  bargain,  which  included
Applicant’s  agreement  to  join  the  U.S.  Air  Force  and  graduate  from  basic  training
without further incident. (Answer2 at page 1.)
3.c.,  3.d.,  3.e.  and  3.f.  As  noted  above,  in  October  of  2015,  Applicant  received
non-judicial punishment for a second DUI. (TR at page 21 line 8 to page 26 line 20, and
GX  3.)  As  a  result,  Applicant  attended  3~5  mandatory  out-patient  Alcohol  and  Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) counseling/treatment sessions from October
to  November  of  2015.  However,  as  the  result  of  a  relapse  in  December  of  2015,
Applicant self-referred himself back to ADAPT, where he was diagnosed as an alcohol
abuser. He completed this counseling in July of 2016. Applicant last consumed alcohol
to the point of intoxication in June of 2019, about two months prior to his hearing. (TR at

"Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  (Company  C)  since  2018.  He honorably  served  on  active  duty  in
the U.S. military from 1999 to 2003 and in the reserve from 2003 to 2006. He seeks to
retain  a  security  clearance,  which  he  has  held  for  an  extended  period.  He  has  a

Applicant  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  (Company  A)  at  different  locations
from  2013  until  he  was  terminated  in  late  October  2017.  In  August  2017,  he  was
working overseas as a systems engineer on a U.S. defense project on an allied nation’s
military  base.  He  was  supposed  to  teach  the  foreign  personnel  how  to  use  and
troubleshoot  the  system.  He  stated  that the foreign  personnel were  lax  about  security,
and he became desensitized to it. In an attempt to fix the system, he violated security
rules  by  logging  into  the  system  using  the  credentials  of  a  member  of  the  foreign
country’s military. (Tr. at 31-64, 73, 86-87, 111-132, 153; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 2; AE A, J, K)
Applicant was questioned about the incident by members of the foreign country’s
military.  He  lied  to  them  and  denied  that  he  used  the  foreign  military  member’s
credentials to log into the system. Applicant also lied orally and in writing to supervisory
personnel from his employer. He later told the truth to an investigator from his employer.
(Tr. at 64-85, 133-145; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE K)
Applicant admitted that he was initially untruthful to the foreign military and to his
supervisors. He stated that he panicked when questioned by the military. He was alone
in a room with four foreign military members, and he feared for his safety and freedom.
He stated that he did not tell his supervisors the truth because he did not trust them. He
stated that once he was questioned by the investigator he was completely forthcoming.
(Tr. at 64-85, 133-145, 158; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE K)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2017,  while  he  was  still  employed  by  Company  A.  Under  the  employment
section,  he  wrote  that  he  was  “warned,  reprimanded,  suspended,  or  disciplined”  by
Company  A  in  September  2017,  with  the  following  description:  “Logged  in  as  another
user to finish a task that I was assigned. An investigation was conducted with the results
being that no information was taken and no malicious intent was done.”  (Tr. at 85; AE

Because  of  his  actions  in  the  foreign  country,  Applicant  was  terminated  by
Company  A  in  late  October  2017.  He  was  hired  by  another  defense  contractor
(Company  B)  in  about  November  2017.  There  was  some  difficulty  in  transferring  his
clearance from Company A to Company B, and he was asked to complete another SF
86, which he submitted in December 2017. He was able to use the September 2017 SF
86 as a template and add anything that had to be updated. (Tr. at 73, 85-88, 145-147;
GE 1; AE A, B)
Applicant  reported  his  employment  with  Company  A  ended  in  November  2017.
He repeated the same information from the previous questionnaire that he was “warned,
reprimanded,  suspended, or disciplined” by  Company  A  in September 2017.  He  wrote
the  reason  for  leaving  the  job  as  “My  position  was  downsized.”  (GE  1)  He  answered
“No” to the following question:
For  this  employment  have  any  of  the  following  happened  to  you  in  the
last seven (7) years?
  Fired
  Quit after being told you would be fired
  Left  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of
misconduct
  Left  by  mutual  agreement
following  notice  of  unsatisfactory
performance
Applicant was notified by Company B’s facility security officer (FSO) on February
22,  2018,  that  his  investigation  was  completed,  and  that  based  on  an  investigation
dated May 2, 2013, he was “granted Secret eligibility” on January 24, 2018. (AE H)
Applicant requested a copy of his DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF)
adjudicative records on April 30, 2018. The DOD CAF replied on May 16, 2018, with a
copy of the September 2017 SF 86. (AE G)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2018. A signed
statement  was  not  obtained,  but  the  interview  was  summarized  in  a  report  of
investigation (ROI). He voluntarily informed the investigator that he was terminated from
Company  A  in  October  2017.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  know  why  his
questionnaire reported his position was downsized, as he completed the questionnaire
in September 2017 while he was working for Company A. (Tr. at 90-91; GE 2; AE I)
Applicant  was  provided  a  copy  of  the  ROI  in  DOHA  interrogatories  and  asked
about its accuracy. He wrote the following in a response, dated May 2, 2019: “I listed my
position as downsized because my manager, [redacted], told me they were doing away
with the position before I was terminated.” (GE 2)
Applicant’s  response  to  the  SOR  was  prepared  by  his attorney,  but  adopted  by
Applicant  as  the  truth  and  notarized  on  June  21,  2019  (48  days  after  his  response  to
DOHA interrogatories). The response stated:
Regarding  the  CAF’s  allegation  that  [Applicant]  submitted  this  SF  86  in
December, and that he reported that he had been “downsized,” he has not
been provided with any evidence that that is the case. He has no memory
of that, has no reason to have lied when he had already been forthcoming
about the same incident and later was forthcoming in an interview.
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  SF  about  his
termination from Employer A. He stated that he submitted the September 2017 SF 86,
but he did not remember submitting a second SF 86. He stated that he had no reason to
lie  because  he  reported  the  underlying  conduct  to  the  DOD.  He  asserted,  without
corroborating documentation, that Company B was aware that he had been terminated
from  Company  A  because  he  put  it  on  his  job  application.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
remember writing on the SF 86 that his position with Company A was “downsized,” but if
he  did  write  it,  it  was  because  when  he  left  the  foreign  country  he  was  told  by  his
supervisor that his position was being downsized and would be backfilled by a foreign
national. (Tr. at 85-89, 108-111, 149-156; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)

"Applicant,  age  34,  is  married  with  four  minor  children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree in 2012.  He has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor since
March 2019. He was previously granted security clearances in 2012 and 2016. (Item 5)
The  SOR  alleged  facts  regarding  misconduct  that  resulted  in  Applicant  being
terminated by Employer 1 in 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a.) and by Employer 2 in 2018 (SOR
¶ 2.b). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each allegation  and proffered mitigating
evidence.  Despite  his  admission  and  references  to  being  terminated  by  Employer  1
throughout the security clearance process, I have construed his 2015 termination as a
“resignation in lieu of termination” to conform to the record evidence, an official business
record stating same. (Item 2; Item 7 at 29)
Applicant worked for Employer 1, as a government contractor, for three years until
he resigned in lieu of being terminated for cause in October 2015 after violating company
policies relating to computer misuse and labor mischarging. He misused his company-
issued computer by accessing sexually explicit materials. He mischarged labor hours to
the U.S. government for time that he was actively engaged in excessive personal use on
his  company-issued  computer.  These  incidents  occurred  while  Applicant  was  at  his
workplace during the workday. (AE A; Item 7 at 29; Items 5, 8)
A   coworker,  who   observed   Applicant  viewing   nude   images  on   two   occasions,
reported   both   incidents  to   Applicant’s  supervisor.  Following   the   initial  incident  in  June
2015, the  supervisor counseled  Applicant about the  appropriate  use  of company  assets
and  labor charging. The  supervisor assumed  Applicant had  corrected  the  behavior until
he  was notified  of  the  second  incident in August 2015, at which time  Employer 1  initiated
an  investigation,  including   active   desktop   monitoring   (ADM)  for  a   period   of   nine   days.
(Items 5, 8)
The   investigation   confirmed   the   August  2015   incident.  The   ADM   revealed   that
Applicant:  1) accessed  nude  and/or sexually  explicit images on  seven  of the  nine  days;
2) was actively  engaged  in an  excessive  amount of  other non-work web  activity over nine
days;  and   3)  took  deliberate   actions  to   conceal  his  internet  searches  and   other  web
activity. Employer 1  concluded  that Applicant mischarged  roughly  42% of  his time, which
equated  to  158  hours  between  the  date  the  allegations  were first reported  and  his last
day  of  employment.  His mischarging, which resulted  in  a  loss of  approximately  $13,874,
included  the  time  he  spent on  viewing  sexually explicit materials and  other non-work web
activity on his company-issued computer. (AE B; Item 7 at 13-30; Item  8)
Applicant knew at the time he was accessing sexually explicit materials that it was
against company policy. He initially denied that he mischarged his labor hours believing
that the time he spent on non-work activity was acceptable because it occurred during
what  he  considered  downtime.  However,  he  eventually  acknowledged  that  he  was
mistaken  in  that  belief,  accepted  responsibility  for  his  actions,  and  recognized  the
seriousness of his misconduct. (FORM Response; Item 8 at 7)
Applicant attributed his 2015 misconduct to an addiction he had to pornography
and sexually explicit materials since he was a teenager.  He resorted to it as a  “mental
escape” when faced with challenges at home or work. He had been in denial that he had
a  problem  until  he  was  faced  with  termination.  He  has  since  sought  and  received
counseling  on  a  regular  basis,  and  developed  strategies  to  help  him  to  overcome  his
addiction and prevent relapse. He increased his involvement in serving his community. In
August 2017, Applicant’s counselor expressed his belief that Applicant would make a full
recovery. (AE B; Item 2; Item 7 at 7, 29-30; Item 8 at 11-13; FORM Response)
In  July  2017,  the  Department  of  the  Navy  notified  Applicant  of  his  proposed
debarment  on  the  basis  of  his  significant  mischarging  in  2015.  In  September  2017,
Applicant  successfully  appealed the debarment. The SDO (Suspending and Debarring
Official) concluded that Applicant appreciated the gravity of the misconduct that formed
the basis of the proposed debarment, and took steps to correct his behavior to ensure
appropriate future conduct. The SDO believed that Applicant no longer presented a threat
to the integrity of the government procurement process. (AE B; Item 7 at 13-30)
Applicant worked for Employer 2 for 23 months until he was terminated for cause
in February 2018, during his probationary period, after his performance and conduct were
deemed  unacceptable.  The  following  summarized  the  incidents  upon  which  his
termination was based: 1) continuously demonstrated a lack of teamwork and cooperation
with  his  coworkers;  2)  continuously  engaged  in  an  argumentative  and  discourteous
manner  toward  others; 3)  routinely made  decisions  on  issues  that  he  was  unwilling  to
discuss when there were differences in opinion; and 4) unwilling to be collaborative, which
negatively impacted productivity and the mission.  (Item 7 at 31-49)
In February 2018, Applicant received a notice outlining the basis of his termination,
including the specific incidents noted above. He was informed of his right to grieve the
action, of  which  he  timely availed  himself. However,  his grievance  was  later cancelled
due to an administrative oversight. He was also advised of a separate right to appeal the
action. There is no indication in the record that he did so. (Item 7 at 44-49)
Applicant attributed his 2018 termination to his inability to effectively communicate.
He  denied  any  malicious  intent and  expressed  regret  for  having  never  been  given  the
opportunity to explain himself  before being terminated.  He has  since  received  counsel
from his spouse and friends to better understand more effective ways of interacting with
coworkers. He has learned to be a better coworker, sought to listen and follow more, and
show  more  trust  and  patience  with  his  chain  of  command.  He  has  implemented
techniques to help him to be a better employee.  He asserted that his current employer
has recognized his growth as an employee. (AE C; Item 2 at 3; Item 7 at 9, 30; FORM
response)
Throughout the security clearance process, Applicant equivocated the derogatory
details  surrounding  his  2015  misconduct.  He  omitted  the  fact  that  he  viewed  sexually
explicit  materials  and  mischarged  labor  when  reporting  the  2015  termination  on  his
February 2016  Declaration  for  Federal  Employment,  March  2016 SCA,  and  during  his
May  2016  security  clearance  interview.  On  his  May  2019  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he
viewed  “explicit material,” but not that he mischarged time; only that it was reported  as
such. During his July 2019 security clearance interview, he stated that he was terminated
for mischarging time and that “pornography was found on his work computer.” After being
confronted  during  his  December  2019  security  clearance
interview,  Applicant
acknowledged that he had not gone into “extensive detail” about the actual reasons for
his 2015 termination “due to the embarrassing nature of situation.” He also claimed that
he did not recall the specific details involved. (Items 3-6; Item 7 at 5, 9)
Applicant understated the reasons for his 2018 termination on his May 2019 SCA
and during his July 2019 interview. When explaining the reason for his termination on the
SCA, he stated: “Supervisor suggested that I [was] not a good fit  for position . . . it was
reported  that  I  did  not  fit  the  temporary  assignment  and  tasks  at  hand.”  During  the
interview, he asserted that he was unsure why he was terminated beyond being told by
his supervisor that that he was simply not a good fit. While he claimed that he did not
recall the official reason given to him for his termination, he asserted that it was not due
to  any  fault  of  his  own.  After  being  confronted  during  his  December  2019  security
clearance interview, Applicant claimed that he listed what he believed to be the official
reason for the termination. He asserted that he did not list “all the specific details due to
not knowing an official reason.” (Item 5 at 18; Item 7 at 4-5, 7)
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  what  he  described  as
miscommunicating the severity of the circumstances surrounding his 2015 misconduct.
He stated that he was “not proud of this choice/issue,” and admitted:
I  was  afraid. Each time  I  discussed  this incident I felt  I  could never grow
beyond it. I felt like I was branded and could never been trusted again . . .
My fear of reprisal of fully saying every detail kept me from full reporting. I
was unaware fully of the government desire to see the total person. [T]his
was  a  grave  error.  [L]ooking  back,  I  remember  being  told  about  the  total
person review, yet I still was afraid of my past. I am deeply upset I couldn’t
just state the facts. . . .
He also apologized for not providing the specific issues underlying his 2018 termination,
which  he  attributed  to  miscommunication  and  a  misunderstanding  of  the  reporting
requirements. In support of mitigation, Applicant stated:
My spouse, current management, and religious leaders are aware of these
situations and have helped me be a better person. They stand as a help to
me against exploitation, manipulation, and duress anyone would attempt to
do  to  get  me  to  act  contrary  to  complete  loyalty  to  the  United  States
Government and her mission. As each day goes by, I remember my lack of
candor and lack of obedience[.] I work each day to be better. I do not dismiss
the actions I did. Each day I try to be better.
Between  2016  and  2020  Applicant  satisfactorily  completed  approximately  15
trainings, which included the topics of ethics, security, and integrity. (AE C).

"Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations  with  explanations.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He earned a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 2005
and 2007, respectively. He married in 2011 and adopted his wife’s child, and they have
three  children  from  the  marriage.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal
contractor, since July 2016. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-19, 43; GE 1)
Applicant  worked  at  Company  W  from  April  2015  to  April  2016.  He  explained
Company W grew while he was there from about 12 to 15 employees to about 20 to 30
employees. He explained the work environment changed. He applied for another job in
March  2016  and  received  an  offer  on  March  31,  2016.  He  completed  his  security
clearance  application  on  April  10,  2016.  He  testified  that  he  had  been  vocal  about
business practices and was told that the company would not eliminate positions. He was
terminated from his position on April 18, 2016. (Tr. 20-23)
Applicant testified that on the day he was terminated from his job he went to the
office and observed that someone was at his workstation and on his computer. He was
met by his supervisor and the director of human resources. He was told his position was
being eliminated. He believed it was because he had been outspoken in the past. He said
they had a civil and tense discussion. (Tr. 24-26)
Applicant testified that he went back to his office, collected his belongings, and left
the building. He sat in his car and felt badly because he had unfinished work he intended
to  complete  and  work  that  he  had  not  yet  started  that  needed  to  be  completed.  This
troubled him greatly because he is a professional and conscientious. He wanted to make
sure his clients were treated correctly. (Tr. 25-27, 46)
Applicant  then  went  home  and  accessed  his  home  computer  and  through  it  he
accessed  a  third-party  software  tracking  program  that  had  Company  W’s  client’s
information. This is a project management program he used while working at Company
W, which tracks the status of the work for each client. Applicant stated he did not access
Company W’s internal data system. He could only see the status of work that was to be
done for the clients. He explained this was the only way he could attend to matters that
he had meant to complete. He arranged client cards and assignments that needed to be
updated  or  archived.  He  said  there  were  things  that  had  not  been  documented  that
needed to be. He deleted six items that he said he had created. (Tr. 27-30, 44-49; GE 2,
3, 5)
Applicant testified that he did not have direct or indirect authorization to do any of
these  things.  He  was  not  granted  approval  by  anyone  at  Company  W  to  access  the
software or make any changes. No one explicitly gave him permission to do this. He said
he left a voice mail for his supervisor, who had been present when he was terminated,
and told her he was going to archive cards on the software that needed modification and
taken off the action list. He said he also told a co-worker what he had done. He admitted
that he was angry and upset after being terminated. He decided to access the software
because it was the only way to make peace with what had happened and to make things
right. He thought Company W  was unfair and unjust and had done a disservice to the
client. He was going to take the high road and make things right for the client. Before he
logged in at home he did not contact anyone at Company W. (Tr. 27-35, 44-58; GE 2, 3,
5)
Applicant stated that when a card is archived it is no longer available at a specified
location to determine its progress status. He archived 46 cards. By archiving a card, it is
put in a different location. It is not deleted. Someone would not be able to find it where
they normally expected it to be. He admitted it would be challenging for the next person
working  for  a  client  to  find  their  information  if  they  did  not  know  where  the  card  was
located. He admitted his actions made things more difficult for his successor. When asked
why  he  archived  a  card  when  he  could  have  notified  someone  that  it  was  inaccurate.
Applicant  explained  that  he  felt  like  it  was  up  to  him  to  do  it.  This  was  his  work  and
responsibility, and he was going to clean it up. He did not have time to modify each card,
so he chose to archive some and inform the supervisors later. When asked why not ask
the  supervisors  first.  He  said  because  he  did  not  think  to  do  so.  He  said  he  thought
professionally the client deserved to have the work performed properly, and he did not
want to leave a bad impression. He stated that he felt like this was the best he could do
to clean up work. He described it as putting things back in the file cabinet and not leaving
things out on the table, figuratively speaking. (Tr. 35-40, 50-58, GE 2, 3, 5)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2017. Applicant
was  confronted  with  information  that  in  about  April  2016  he  was  terminated  from
employment at Company W and before the IT department deactivated access to one of
the systems, Applicant had remotely accessed the system and began deleting data until
another analysist  discovered  it,  and  Applicant’s  access  was  suspended.  Applicant  told
the  investigator  it  never  happened.  He  said  that  he  never  remotely  accessed  any  of
Company  W’s  systems.  The  only  time  his  access  was  denied  was  the  day  he  was
terminated. He told the investigator that he was called and informed that he was going to
be terminated. He could not provide any other information to the investigator with regards
to his employment termination from Company W. (Tr. 35-40; GE 2)
Applicant explained at his hearing that he interpreted the investigator’s questions
as asking if he had accessed Company W’s internal systems, which he said he had not.
He admitted that the only Internet system he could access at home through Company W
was the third-party software. He said he did not think the third-party software, which he
said was an external system, had anything to do with Company W’s system. He thought
the  investigator  had  asked  had  he  gone  into  Company  W’s  system  and  deleted  and
manipulated data. He admitted he never provided clarification or explained the nuance
he  was  relying  upon  to  the  investigator.  He  said  he  did  not  lie,  but  rather  it  was  a
misunderstanding.  I  did  not  find  Applicant  credible  and  find  he  deliberately  misled  the
investigator by concealing his actions upon termination from employment with Company
W. (Tr. 35-41, 58-61)
Applicant admitted he had pornography on his work computer. He admitted that it
was  “illicit  material”,  and  he  believed  it  was  against  work  policy  to  have  it  on  his work
computer. He downloaded photos from the Internet to his computer. He said the photos
were  boudoir  photos  of  his  wife  and  others.  He  liked  them,  so  he  kept  them  on  his
computer for access. When asked why he had illicit photos on his computer, he explained
he thought they were nice, good photographic work, and he was able to view them as a
break from work. He did not refer to the photos as pornography. (Tr. 61-65)
Applicant stated  that he  was not making  good  decisions while  working  at Company
W.  It was very stressful. He should not have had  illicit material  on  his work computer. He
should have  gotten  permission  to  access the  software tied  to  Company  W’s clients.  He  is
not  proud   of   his  conduct.   He  believed   there  was  a   misunderstanding   between   the
government  investigator and himself. (Tr. 66-68)
Two character witnesses testified on Applicant’s behalf. His manager of two years
stated that he has worked closely with him on projects as a mentor and technical advisor.
He is dedicated to his work and his performance has been excellent. He is hard working,
conscientious,  and  takes  on  many  tasks  and  provides  exemplary  work.  Applicant  had
discussed issues he had with his previous employer with the witness, but not the issues
raised by the SOR. (Tr.71-75)
Another witness, who Applicant has worked for on military and sensitive projects,
testified that Applicant has met all of the objectives of his work, on time and within budget.
They deal with very complex tasks. Applicant is reliable and trustworthy. The witness was
not aware of the contents of the SOR. (Tr. 77-78)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old and has worked for a major defense contractor as a cyber
security  engineer  since  September  2018.  After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant
studied  for  one  year  (July  2003-June  2004)  at  the  U.S.  Military  Academy  Preparatory
School, which is also known as West Point Prep. This education constituted active-duty
service in the Army. He did not continue his education at West Point and was honorably
discharged from the Army.  He earned a bachelor’s degree  in August 2007  and  began
working  for  a  major  defense  contractor  (E1)  in  November  2007  as  an  information
assurance  engineer.  He  also  continued  his studies  and  earned  two  master’s  degrees,
one in December 2013 and a second in April 2015, and a Ph.D. in March 2021. He was
first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  about  November  2007  and  has  continuously
maintained  his  eligibility.  He  has  lived  with  his  girlfriend  since  2017.  They  have  no
children. (Tr. at 20-21; GE 2 at 14; AE C.)
Applicant’s last day of work at E1 was August 30, 2018.  He had previously given
notice of his intent to resign his position at that company and had accepted a position with
his current employer (E2). In the afternoon of his last day of work, he downloaded over
15,000 files onto his personal USB external hard drive (USB Device), and when he left
the  employer’s  premises,  he  took  the  USB  Device  with  him.  On  September  4,  2018,
investigators  at  E1  were  alerted  to  this  unusual  downloading  activity  by  a  departing
employee and investigated the circumstances. (GE 3 at 1.)
The  investigators  found  that  the  file  path  for  the  downloaded  files  was  titled
“Personaldocs\[E1].” They issued  a  memorandum  to  Applicant  (the  E1  Memorandum),
dated September 6, 2018, even though he no longer worked there. Applicant signed the
E1 Memorandum the next day, acknowledging receipt, and returned it to the investigators.
In  the  E1  Memorandum,  the  investigators  advised  Applicant  that  he  had  violated  two
company  policies  set  forth  in  the  E1  Corporate  Information  Protection  Manual  by
connecting  his USB  Device to  E1’s information  network and  by  downloading files from
E1’s network onto his personal USB Device  without authorization. The two policies are
described in the E1 Memorandum  as follows:
1.   Section  106.6.7(1)  - titled Storage of Information on Personally Owned
Information Technology Assets; and
2.   Section  106.6.7(3)  -  titled Connectivity of Personally Owned Information
Technology Assets to [E1] Infrastructure.
The investigators instructed Applicant to return his USB Device to E1, which he did. They
advised him and sought his acknowledgment that E1 may delete E1 information from the
device and in the process may also delete Applicant’s information. In a separate internal
E1 memorandum, dated December 10, 2018, which was not shared with Applicant at that
time, the writer noted that the files recovered from his USB Device  numbered 15,179 with
a total amount of 8.7 gigabytes of data transferred from E1’s network to the USB Device.
The investigators compared that number of files with a full-year count of the number of
files Applicant would transfer in the performance of his work duties, which was 22,599.
This comparison highlighted the unusual nature of Applicant’s actions on the day he left
E1. (Tr. at 39, 66-68; GE 3 at 1-2.)
The  December  10,  2018  internal  memorandum  references  the  allegation  under
investigation as follows:
Allegation:   Data  Exfiltration  with  CI/CT  nexus  (SUBSTANTIATED)
(emphasis in original)
The   term   CI/CT   stands  for  Counterintelligence/Counter  Terrorism.  The   USB
Device was wiped  in its entirety  on  September 17, 2018.  The  memorandum  also
states:   “On  October 9,   2018,   Adverse  information   was  filed   against   [Applicant].”
(GE 3 at 1.)
In  his  August  2019  clearance  reinvestigation  background  interview,  Applicant
initially  denied  any  personal  history  of  misuse  of  any  information  technology  system,
including any non-compliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations. He was
then confronted by the background investigator with information from his E1 employment
records regarding his actions on August 30, 2018. Applicant was advised that as a result
of his actions on that date he was not eligible for rehire at E1. He testified at the hearing
that  he  learned  for  the  first  time  during  his background  interview  that  E1  regarded  his
actions as improper. Applicant admitted to the investigator that on his last day at E1, he
accidentally downloaded E1 proprietary information (E1PI) onto his USB Device when he
was hurriedly downloading his personal files onto his device that he wanted to take with
him. He explained that this happened because he had used his company’s laptop for both
work and personal purposes over his 11 years of working at E1. He said he downloaded
onto  the  E1  network  research  articles  that  he  read  for  his  own  education  as  well  as
information  related  to  his  doctoral  studies  when  he  was  pursuing  his  Ph.D.  as  well  as
information related to his master’s degrees prior to that. This information was downloaded
onto the same drive on the E1 network that he used for work-related activities. He claimed
that in his haste, he inadvertently downloaded E1PI along with his personal files. (Tr. at
39-40; GE 2 at 6-7.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  K  - The  SOR  sets  forth  a  single  allegation  under  this
guideline in which the Government alleges that Applicant deliberately downloaded E1PI
onto  his  USB  Device  in  August  2018  while  employed  by  E1.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
wrote that his actions were not deliberate. He wrote that he only intended to download his
educational materials related to his master’s degree studies as well as over two years of
his  studies  in  his  Ph.D.  program.  He  explained  that  his  E1  work  laptop  was  limited  to
unclassified information. In mitigation, he commented that he immediately complied with
the request of E1’s security manager to deliver the USB Device to the manager. He also
argued  that  his  actions  were  infrequent  and  the  result  of  inadequate  training  while  he
worked at E1.
Paragraph  2,  Guideline  M  - This  paragraph  of  the  SOR  cross-alleges  under
Guideline M the same facts alleged under Guideline K. In his Answer, Applicant admitted
the disqualifying facts, using the words “I accept” rather than “I admit.” In mitigation, he
noted  that  this  incident  occurred  nearly  three  years  earlier  and  no  similar  action  has
occurred.  He  also  commented  that  no  classified  information  was  copied  onto  his  USB
Device. He repeated that his actions were not intentional. He claimed that E1 permitted
data to be transferred between computer systems using external hard drives, though he
acknowledged that transferring E1PI to a personal mobile device was not authorized.
Paragraph 3, Guideline E – This paragraph also cross-alleges under Guideline E
the  facts  set  forth  under  Guideline  K.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  the  allegation.
However, his denial was based upon his mistaken belief that the Guideline E allegation
concerns a falsification in his SCA for his failure to disclose the August 30, 2018 security
incident. In fact, the SCA predated August 30, 2018, by three weeks. Instead, the cross-
allegation  concerns  the  incident  itself,  as  an  independent  personal  conduct  security
concern.
At the hearing, Applicant testified at length about the circumstances surrounding
the August 30, 2018 incident. He explained that E1 had two computer networks and that
on occasion information had to be transferred from one network to the other. Certain files
were so large that they could only be transferred by a USB  external hard drive device.
The administrative process to do this required the completion of a form by the employee
transferring the files. The form must be approved to authorize the employee to perform
transfers between networks. While performing his duties at E1, Applicant had submitted
this form and had permission to transfer files on a USB drive between the two networks.
Without  such   an   approval,  the   system   would  not  deny   him   access   to   the   company’s
network  when  he  plugged  in a  USB  hard drive. Applicant claimed  that  it was not necessary
to  use  a  company-issued  USB  device to  transfer files.  This testimony  is inconsistent with
the  E1  Memorandum,  which stated  that  Applicant had  violated  company  policy  prohibiting
the  connection  of a  personally  owned  device to  E1’s  technology  infrastructure.  (Tr.  at 22-
26; GE 3 at 2.)
Applicant further testified that he was required to use an external USB device only
for work-related information. He admitted that one mistake he made on August 30, 2018,
was  that  he  used  an  external  USB  device  to  transfer  his  personal  files.  That  required
getting permission from “IT.” He claimed he was unaware of that requirement at the time
he left the company. The form he had previously prepared to obtain permission to use an
external  USB  device  required  confirmation  that  the  permission  sought  was  to  perform
routine work-related activities. (Tr. at 26-28.)
A  complication  that  increased  the  risk  of  Applicant’s  actions  is  that  he  did  not
separate his personal files from his work files on his section of the E2 shared drive used
to  store  information.  Under  any  single  “parent  folder,”  he  would  have  subfolders
containing both personal and work files. He referred in his testimony to “a nested tree” of
parent  folders  and  sub-folders  with  further  sub-folders  and  even  more  sub-folders.  He
used a chronological approach to his filing system so that all of his activities  in a given
period, both work-related and personal, would be in that one main file, separated into sub-
folders. As a result, when he copied over to his USB Device a parent folder that he thought
had  his  academic  literature  as  well  as  personal  information,  such  as  tax  and  pay
information,  the  parent  folder  would  also  include  sub-folders  with  E1PI.  The  Windows
copying technology he used was simple “drag and drop,” so he dragged and copied file
folders that contained both work-related files and personal files. In that process, nothing
was removed from the E1 system, it was just copied. He did not review each folder to see
if it had only personal files. He was going through the process of  copying hundreds of
folders hastily over an hour or two at the end of his last workday at E1 before Labor Day
weekend. He agreed he made a mistake in how he handled the copying. Nevertheless,
he  testified  that  it  was  only  his  intent  to  copy  his  academic  and  personal  files.  He
purchased  the  USB  Device  about  a  week  earlier.  It  was  solely  for  the  purpose  of
transferring his files in connection with his change of employment. (Tr. at 28-31, 47-55,
71-74.)
Applicant also transferred files from his emails that included both personal emails
and work emails. He testified that E1 allowed personal use of its email system. Some of
the email files he copied may have been work-related. He believes that a large number
of the other files he transferred onto his USB Device were publicly available documents
that he was required to download periodically for work purposes. Those files  are large
and numerous. (Tr. 31-34.)
Applicant contends that with the permission he had to use portable USB devices
to transfer files for work-related purposes, he did not violate any company policies by his
actions on August 30, 2018. He does not believe he violated any policy by plugging his
USB Device into the E1’s network on that date. (Tr. at 76-77; GE 3 at 2.)
With  hindsight,  Applicant  now  realizes  that  he  should  have  talked  to  E1’s  IT
Department and explained what he wanted to do with his personal computer files, even
though he already had “USB access” approval. The day he left the company, he had an
exit interview in which he turned over all of his IT equipment. He had the opportunity then
to talk about his use of the personal USB Device, but the subject never came up since
his  actions  were  only  discovered  in  the  following  days.  His  job  at  E1  was  related  to
information security in connection with a specific DoD project. His new job at E2 was also
dealing with information security, but at the organization level. Nevertheless, he insisted
at the hearing that the information he claims he copied inadvertently would not be helpful
to him in his new position with E2. (Tr. at 61-65, 76-77.).
Other Mitigating  Evidence
When Applicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation, he claims
he  learned for the first time the seriousness of his actions when he left E1. He decided
to  take  actions  to  avoid  future  problems  like  this  one,  and  he  enrolled  in  a  cyber
awareness course provided by DoD in 2019 and again in 2021. He also teaches a course
in  cyber  security  at  a  local  university.  In  connection  with  that  experience,  he  further
educated himself on such matters. (Tr. at 39-45; AE D at 1-2.)
Applicant  testified  that  prior  to  the  August  2018  incident,  he  had  never  been
counseled or written up for being careless with information technology, nor has he had
any security issues since the incident. He testified that since he was instructed by E1’s
investigators in September 2018 to return the USB Device, he has been transparent with
everyone about the incident. (Tr. at 45-46.)
Applicant’s exit from E1 in 2018 was the first time he had ever gone through this
transition process. He had three weeks from the date of his new job offer from E2 to his
last day at E1. He had much to do, including a geographic relocation. He deferred the
copying process to his last day of work and performed it quickly in a limited amount of
time. He did not take the time to see what sub-folders were included in each folder he
copied  and  whether  the  folders  he  was  copying  contained  any  E1PI.  He  testified  that
throughout his 11 years at E1,  he was aware of E1’s rule that you cannot take E1PI when
you terminate your employment with the company. (Tr. at 55-56.)

violation of Company A policy. Also under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant
falsified material facts regarding his file download activity during two different interviews

high-volume file transfer and initiated an immediate investigation. (Items 6, 7)
Company A determined that the files contained on Applicant’s personal USB drive
included Company A proprietary information, third-party proprietary information (related
to  two  U.S.  government  programs  on  which  Applicant  was  contracted  to  work),  and
export-controlled  information  (as  designated  by  the  International  Traffic  in  Arms
Regulations (ITAR) and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)). Those files
were  marked  Company  A  Proprietary.  Company  A  concluded
that  Applicant’s
downloading and transfer of files to his personal USB drive was a deliberate attempt  to
obtain proprietary data for outside use, which was unauthorized and a direct violation of
the following Company A policies: 1) Code of Conduct and 2) Protection of Company A
and Third-Party Information. (Items 6, 7, 10, 11)
The investigation revealed no evidence that Applicant ever transferred those files
from  his  USB  drive  to  any  other  computer,  that  the  USB  drive  ever  left  his  personal
residence where it had been stored, that any classified data resided on the USB drive, or
that  Applicant  had  any  previous  security  incidents  on  his  record.  Nevertheless,  the
investigation concluded that Applicant’s behavior and actions, including false statements
he made during the investigation, were “Insider Threat Activity” and a risk to all Company
A  information  systems.  As  a  result,  on  July  8,  2019,  Company  A  expedited  his
employment separation, seized all of Applicant’s computing devices, removed his badge
access, escorted him off Company A’s property, and submitted an adverse statement in
the DOD personnel security clearance and access database. (Items 6, 7)
On  July  8,  2019,  after  Applicant  was  escorted  off  its  property,  Company  A
discovered  information  on  Applicant’s  seized  laptop  which  revealed  that  he  also
downloaded and transferred files from his unclassified work computer to eight computer
discs  on  July  2,  2019.  Company  A  determined  that  the  files  on  the  discs  contained
Company A cyber security-related tools and training, but did not provide the results of its
forensic investigation of the discs which was “in progress” as of July 12, 2019, the date
of  its  final  report  of  the  misconduct  for  which  Applicant’s  separation  was  expedited.
Neither the report nor any other record evidence indicated what, if any, conclusions that
investigation formed about the presence of classified information on the discs or whether
Applicant’s  actions  in  downloading  or  transferring  the  files  to  the  discs  violated  any
Company  A  policies  or  other  rules.  While  acknowledging  that  “there  is  currently  no
evidence that Applicant copied the discs for his own use and/or removed the discs from
[Company  A’]s  premises,”  the  Government  argued  in  its  FORM  that  Applicant’s  disc-
related file transfer activity remained relevant “for the concerns it potentially raises under
Guidelines K, M, and E.” (Item 7)
Applicant denied that his disc-related file transfer activity was either unauthorized
or  violated  any  policies  or  rules.  Given  the  timing  of  the  discovery,  Applicant  was  not
questioned about his disc-related file transfer activity during Company A’s investigation.
However,  he  addressed  it  during  his  December  2019  security  clearance  interview  (SI)
and in his SOR answer. During his SI, Applicant explained that he never copied any files
onto discs for his personal use and that his team regularly copied files onto discs in the
ordinary course of business. In his SOR answer, he provided more details about the file
transfer  and  reiterated  that  it  was  not  done  for  his  personal  use.  He  clarified  that  he
transferred  the files (which  were  too  voluminous  to email)  onto  the discs  to facilitate a
successful transition of the systems he managed to the team member who was taking
over his position. He maintained that he gave the discs directly to his team member and
never transferred the files to any other machine or device. (Item 3 at 1; Item 5 at 4)
Applicant  acknowledged  being  aware  of  the  proper  security  procedures  for
handling  classified  information  when  he  was  employed  by  Company  A.  However,  he
claimed that he had not had any training on handling proprietary information. He asserted
that  he  always  tried  to  follow  security  rules  and  that  anytime  he  witnessed  someone
violating security regulations,  he  would  counsel them  and  train  them.  As  of  December
2019, he had not had any security-related incidents while employed by Company B. (5 at
5; Item 7 at 4)
In  September  2017,  Applicant  signed  an  employment  agreement  in  connection
with  his  Company  A  employment  entitled  “Employee  Agreement  –  Proprietary
Information,  Inventions  and  Other  Intellectual  Property.”  Among  the  matters  to  which
Applicant agreed were that his work product while employed by Company A was the sole
and  exclusive  property  of  Company  A  unless  expressly  released  in  writing.  He  also
agreed that he was prohibited from using, for his own  or another’s benefit, not only his
own  work  product,  but  also  any  Company  A  or  third-party  proprietary  information  with
which he had been entrusted or had otherwise acquired by virtue of his employment with
Company A. (Item 9)
SOR ¶¶  3.c and  3.d
In  his  August  2019  SCA,  Applicant  reported  that  he  had  been  “warned,
reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined” in July 2019 by Company A because he “used
a  USB  to  transfer  data/files  from  [his]  unclassified  work  computer.”  He  explained:  “My
intentions  were  to  bring  any  personal  forms  containing  my  [personally  identifiable
information (PII)], databases or tools I created (via excel, viso [sic], word, powerpoint) to
build  a  portfolio  [sic]  I  can  reference  prior  work  that  assisted/streamlined  tasks  for  my
position.” He asserted that the files that he transferred  were “from an  OPEN area” and
“from [his] personal UNCLASSIFIED computer.” While he acknowledged that he was told
by a Company A investigator that the files he transferred were “[Company A] Proprietary,”
he  claimed  that  the  files  he  transferred  “were  not  marked  with  any  type  of  Proprietary
Markings (header/footer etc).” (Item 4 at 16)
Applicant answered  “Yes”  on his SCA when asked whether  he  had  “introduced,
removed,  or  used  hardware,  software,  or  media  in  connection  with  any  information
technology  system  without  authorization,  when  specifically  prohibited  by  rules,
procedures, or regulations” within the  prior seven  years. He reported  July  2019  as the
date of the incident. For reasons not explained in the record, Applicant did not report on
his SCA that he was previously granted a security clearance. (Item 4 at 35-36, 39-40)
Applicant  was  interviewed  twice  about  the facts  and  circumstances  surrounding
his Company A file transfer activity. The first interview was conducted by a Company A
investigator  during  its  July  2019  investigation  (Interview  1).  The  second  interview  was
conducted  by  a  DOD  investigator  in  December  2019  in  connection  with  Applicant’s
security clearance background investigation (Interview 2). (Items 5, 7)
Company  A  concluded  that,  during  Interview  1,  Applicant  provided  false
statements,  including  his  self-described  “unfamiliarity”  with  Company  A  and  National
Industrial  Security  Program  Operating  Manual  (NISPOM)  polices.  When  initially
questioned during Interview 1, Applicant stated that he had not used any USB drive. After
the question was rephrased, he stated that he was uncertain as to previous usage of a
USB  drive.  After being reminded that  Company A  conducts user monitoring,  Applicant
reported that he discovered a USB drive on his desk. When asked to describe the data
saved  on  the  USB  drive,  Applicant  claimed  that  only  PII  information  containing  social
security  number (SSN)  data  was  stored  on  the  USB  drive.  After  he  was  informed  that
Company A’s system  indicated  over 2,000  documents were downloaded  onto  the  USB
drive, Applicant admitted that he copied personal files and databases that he created with
the intention to use them for reference purposes in the future. He later clarified that the
files on the USB drive were intended to be used as references for future work outside of
Company  A.  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  taken  the  USB  drive  to  his  home,  but
maintained that he never connected it to his personal computer. (Item 7)
During  Interview  1,  Applicant  signed  a  voluntary  statement  admitting  that  he
“copied  data  from  [his]  unclassified  [Company  A]  computer,  with  the  intension  [sic]  of
using files for reference purposes at a later date.” He explained:
The  files were going  to  be  a  means of  “referenced  worked” from  a  coworker
whom  [sic] trained  me  when  I initially  started.  The  files came  from  my  [two
U.S.  government   programs  on   which  Applicant  worked]  systems,  large
networks with  many  hours devoted  to  each  program. The  [USB  drive]  that
was used  to  transfer the  data  has left  [Company  A] property/grounds, and  I
stored  it at home. While  it was there, the  [USB  drive]  was not used.  I was
unaware of  the  [Company  A] Proprietary  Policy.  My  understanding  was that
it was unclassified, did  not contain classified  information  so  being  able to
reference prior work was not an issue.  . . .” (Items 7, 8)
When  initially  questioned  about  his  Company  A  file  transfer  activity  during
Interview 2, Applicant addressed both his USB drive and disc-related file transfer activity.
He  denied  transferring  any  files  onto  discs  for  his  personal  use,  but  admitted  that  he
transferred files to his USB  drive for his personal use. He asserted that he transferred
only his personal files from a folder labeled with his last name from his unclassified work
computer to his USB drive around spring of 2019. He also acknowledged that he later
realized that a folder labeled with the name of one of the U.S. government programs on
which  he  worked  was  also  copied.  He  did  not  indicate  the  specific  timeframe  that
realization occurred. He claimed that he intended to use the personal files he copied to
his USB drive  as a portfolio to assist him with a job  search, and that he had not been
offered another job at the time that he transferred the files. (Item 5 at 4-5)
After initial questioning during Interview 2, Applicant was asked if there were any
records or individuals that would contradict the information he provided about his USB-
related file transfer activity. He replied that he believed that there were not. He was then
confronted with information that the files were transferred two days prior to him submitting
his  resignation.  Applicant  denied  transferring  the  files  two  days  prior  to  submitting  his
resignation and reiterated that he transferred them in the spring of 2019 before he had a
job offer. But he admitted that he may have transferred his Company B offer letter from
his work computer to his personal USB drive two days prior to submitting his resignation
letter. (Item 5 at 5)
In his SOR answer, Applicant denied falsifying any information that he provided
during Interviews 1 and 2. He stated: “To the best of my knowledge, I did not lie or attempt
to withhold that I had used a USB thumb drive” from the investigator during Interview 1.
He also claimed that the use of USB devices to transfer files was practiced almost daily
on his Company A team and that he was “a bit confused” when the investigator explained
that his file transfer activity was against Company A policy. He reaffirmed the spring of
2019 timeline he gave to the investigator during Interview 2. Additionally, he clarified that
he gave the investigator “a broad timeline” of spring of 2019 because he did not recall the
exact date. He affirmed that he is now certain that his initial file transfer activity occurred
in  “early  spring  of  2019.”  He  also  reaffirmed:  “Again  the  files  downloaded  prior  to  me
giving notice were personal . . . The files that were downloaded days prior to me giving
my notice, was again to copy any [Company B] offer related documentation.” (Item 3)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  maintained  that,  in  “early  spring  of  2019,”  he
intended only to transfer a folder containing his personal files to the USB drive, including
“blank  tools  (weekly  checklist,  to-do  list),  school/certification  study  material,  and
documents pertaining solely to [him].” He acknowledged that in “mid to late June 2019,”
he discovered that the personal folder he transferred to his USB drive also contained an
additional folder named after one of the U.S. government programs on which he worked.
He claimed that he did not intentionally transfer that additional folder as he knew that it
contained information that did not pertain to him. The record did not indicate when or if
he notified Company A of that discovery prior to confrontation. (Item 3)
SOR ¶¶  4.a  through 4.k
Applicant’s admissions and his credit reports confirm the 11 debts alleged in the
SOR  totaling $48,087, including four utility accounts totaling  $533; six federal student-
loan accounts totaling $31,894: and a $15,660 charged-off automobile loan. (Items 3, 12,
13)
Applicant paid  the  automobile-loan  account in  September 2018  (SOR ¶  4.k) and
three   of  the   four  utility  accounts   alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   4.a   through   4.d.  He   paid   the   debt
alleged  in SOR ¶  4.d  ($26)  in November 2020. The  record does not indicate  when  he  paid
the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  4.b  ($108)  and  4.c ($332).  Applicant  did not establish  that
the  debt  alleged  in  SOR ¶  4.a  ($67)  was either paid or disputed  as  claimed  in  his  SOR
answer. In  fact,  one  of the  documents he  provided   corroborated  that  allegation.  (AE  K
through  P; GE  5 at 8;  GE 13 at 2-3)
In his August 2019 SCA, Applicant reported that he owed $7,000 to University A
for unpaid tuition that was not covered by his GI Bill. He estimated that the delinquency
began in July 2017. He planned to pay the balance once he determined which collection
agency was holding the debt. During his December 2019 SI, he revealed that he received
a phone call in October 2019 advising him that he owed the U.S. Department of Education
(USDOE)  over  $40,000  (and  not  $7,000  to  University  A).  He  denied  receiving  any
delinquency or collection notices prior to that phone call, and believed any such notices
must have been sent to either a wrong or prior address. He asserted, without providing
corroborating documents, that he initiated a plan  in October 2019 to pay $5 per month
towards his USDOE debt and was current with those payments as of December 2019.
(Item 4 at 37-38; Item 5 at 3-6)
In February 2020, Applicant entered into an agreement to rehabilitate his federal
student-loan accounts with a collection agent for the USDOE, including the six accounts
alleged in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 4.e through 4.j) and one account that was not alleged. At
that time, the total amount due for all seven accounts was $45,170. He agreed to make
at least nine monthly payments of $352 beginning February 2020, and expected to have
his  accounts  fully  rehabilitated  by  November  2020.  In  his  May  2020  response  to
interrogatories, he claimed that he was current with those payments and had reduced the
balance  to  approximately  $37,000.  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  corroborating
documents to show that any payments were made or that the accounts have been fully
rehabilitated. The information reported about these accounts on his January 2021 credit
report did not establish that they have been rehabilitated or otherwise resolved. (AE J;
Item 3; Item 5 at 8)
Applicant attributed his indebtedness to the fact that his GI Bill had “run out” as he
was finishing his degree with University A and did not cover the entirety of his expenses
as he anticipated. Without indicating to what year(s) he was referring, he asserted that he
was  “unable  to  pay  any  amount”  towards  his  debts  due  to  underemployment  with  an
annual salary of $45,000, which he used to pay for his living expenses. He claimed that
he has “made a point to get [himself] out of debt and work on [his] credit” since becoming
employed by Company B, with an annual salary that increased by “more than  double.”
He reported that he successfully increased his credit score from “very poor to good.” The
record did not otherwise specify his relevant income history and expenses, or other details
about his overall financial stability. It also did not indicate whether he  had any financial
counseling  or  the  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  have  impacted  his
finances. (Item 3; Item 5 at 8)
Whole Person  Concept
Applicant’s  work  performance  and  character  are  highly  regarded  by  nine
individuals who wrote reference letters on his behalf. None of those individuals signified
that  they  were  aware  of  the  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  or  Applicant’s  USB-related  file
transfer  activity.  (AE  A  –  I).  Applicant  asserted  that  three  of  the  individuals  who  were
Company A coworkers (AE A, C, F) were aware of that activity. (Item 5 at 5) However,
the extent of that awareness was not indicated in the record. Two of those three Company
A coworkers now work with Applicant at Company B (AE A, C).
During his Air Force service, Applicant served as an Assistant Non-Commissioned
Officer in Charge (NCO) of Security Forces Training and alternate security manager (SM).
His  duties  as  SM  included  creating  security  policies  and  regulations.  He  also  was
entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the security clearance information of over
7,000  airman.  His  supervisor  stated  that  Applicant  was  “always  very  respectful  of
classified information and was a stickler of rules and regulations.” (AE D)
",False
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old  and  has  worked  for  a  DoD  contractor  as  a  systems
engineer  since  2014.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  has  earned  a  number  of
professional  certifications.  He  married  and  divorced  once  as  a  young  man.  He
subsequently cohabited with a woman for a number of years and married her in 2008. He
has an adult stepchild. (Tr. at 21, 35.)
After graduating from high school in 1991, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force
with the intent to serve until his mandatory retirement. He wrote in his SCA that he was
discharged  in  April  1993  under  “General  Honorable  Conditions.”  He  then  wrote
“Discharge Detail Other Than Honorable,” suggesting that the character of his discharge
was Under Other Than Honorable Conditions.”  He also wrote in his SCA that the reason
for  his  discharge  was  a  “Reduction  in  forces.”  He  provided  the  same  reason  at  the
hearing. (SCA at18; Tr. at 22.)
In his May 2019 background interview (2019 Interview), Applicant disclosed that
he was discharged for misconduct. The only detail he said he could recall was the phrase
conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline.  In an April 2016 background interview
(2016  Interview),  Applicant  was  more  forthcoming  about  his  military  discharge.  He
disclosed  that  he  received  a  letter  of  reprimand  in  January  1993  for  disrespecting  a
superior and served a day, but not overnight, in the Correctional Custody Unit. He had
also been repeatedly counseled for dereliction of duties and for a poor attitude. On two
occasions,  he  received  letters  of  counseling  for  dereliction  of  duties.  He  blamed  his
superior officer for treating him differently than others due to his religious faith. In the 2016
Interview, he claimed he was told that he was being released under a reduction in forces
separation process. (2019 Interview at 6; 2016 Interview at 13.)
Applicant attended a class at a junior college when he was a senior in high school.
During the period August 1995 to May 1997, Applicant attended a tech school and earned
two  IT  certificates  of  completion.  In  subsequent  years,  he  was  awarded  additional  IT
certifications, mostly through self-study. Since 2014 or 2015, he has worked for a Federal
contractor as a systems engineer. He held a security clearance when he served in the Air
Force. He was not granted an interim security clearance after submitting his SCA in 2015.
His employer would like Applicant to have a clearance so that he could work on classified
matters, but he can continue his employment at his company without a clearance. It would
be helpful to both his employer and Applicant if he had a clearance to work directly on
classified  contracts  rather  than  around  the  perimeter  in  an  unclassified  environment.
(SCA at 13; Tr. at 20, 22-24, 27-32.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph 1, Guideline  H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
In his Answer, Applicant admitted  the facts alleged in the two subparagraphs of
the  SOR  under  this  guideline.  In  his  Supplemental  Answer,  he  specifically  denied  the
allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. The specific facts regarding each of the allegations are as follows:
1.a  –  Use of marijuana in April  and  May 2019  –  In his 2019 Interview, Applicant
reported that he was given an item sample containing ingredients made from cannabis
by a vendor at an April 2019 Earth Day event. This occurred about a month before the
interview.  He consumed the product thinking it was a candy and not knowing it was a
marijuana edible (Edible). This was the first time he ever consumed “marijuana,”  using
that term broadly to include all products derived from marijuana. At the event, which is
generally  associated  with  marijuana,  Edibles  were  for  sale.  Applicant  claimed  that  the
item he consumed was not labeled to show that it contained marijuana. He later learned
that he had consumed an Edible. He testified it was not his intent to consume marijuana
or a marijuana product when he attended this event. (Tr. at 36-39; GE 2 at 9.)
In  his  2019  Interview,  Applicant  further  reported  that  his  wife  subsequently
purchased more Edibles at a cannabis dispensary in Applicant’s home state  where the
sale of such products is legal under state law. Applicant deliberately consumed Edibles a
few more times after his first experience with Edibles. At the time of the 2019 Interview
on May 21, 2019, he was still consuming Edibles. He said that was taking the Edibles to
ease shoulder pain and to sleep better at night. He intended to see his doctor in the near
future “to get a note for this.” At the time of the Interview, Applicant acknowledged that he
was aware that Edibles were not legal under Federal law. (GE 2 at 9.)
Applicant  provided  additional  information  in  his  October  2019  responses  to
DOHA’s Interrogatories about his past use of Edibles. He confirmed the accuracy of the
report  of  his  2019  Interview  regarding  his  past  drug  use  and  adopted  the  statements
contained in the report. He also wrote:
I would like  to  ensure clarification  that this [past use  of  edibles] was a  rather
desperate  occurrence  due  to  my  shoulder pain  preventing  me  from  sleeping
and this was only  done  after several (4-5) days of  (almost) no  sleep due to
the shoulder pain.
Hence  forth  [sic]  I have resorted to the prescription medications for pain as
prescribed  by my doctor despite the  negative effects associated.
He  also  corrected  a  statement  in  the  report  of  the  2019  Interview,  noting  that:  “The
strength of the product in question, while 10 mg per standard dose, was divided and was
not 15mg [as written in the report]. The approximate dosing was 2.5-5 mg.” (GE 2 at 3-4,
19, 21-22.)
In his January 2020 Answer, Applicant confirmed that he consumed Edibles in April
and May 2019 to help him sleep after “excessive periods of time when [he was] unable to
sleep.” He wrote that his decision to consume Edibles was made out of “desperation.” He
wrote further:
I have, as intended,  engaged  with  my  primary  care  physician  in exploring
FDA  approved  medications to  assist with  my  incremental sleep  problems.
My  primary  care physician  and  I are exploring  medications to  resolve  sleep
issues  that  do   not  leave   lingering   effects  the   following   day   that   could
potentially affect my work performance.
Answer at 1.
At the  hearing, Applicant explained  that he  consumed  the  Edibles  in 2019  under
extraordinary   circumstances.   He  experienced   significant   pain  in   his  shoulder  due   to   a
work-related  injury  and  was unable to  sleep  for about three  days. He ate  the  Edibles to
help him  sleep  on  two or three  occasions  while  he  was waiting  to  see  his workers’  comp
doctor.   He  made  a  point  that   he  only   used   a   “quarter”   of  the   “standard   dosing” in  the
square Edible  and  that his use  was infrequent  and  an  “isolated  incident.”   He waited  “a
very  short period  of  time” to  see  his workers’  comp  doctor, an  orthopedist.  The  doctor
gave  Applicant  a  prescription  for his pain.  The  medication  helped  him  sleep  without using
the  Edibles. He  also made  a  comment about  how  long  it takes  to  be  seen  by  a  workers’
comp   doctor,   which  was  inconsistent  with   his  earlier  testimony   that  he   had   an
appointment  with   that   doctor  after  only   waiting   a   short  time.   Also,  he   provided   no
testimony   regarding   his  primary   care  physician   or  that  doctor’s  role   in   “exploring
medications” with Applicant.   (Tr. at 40-50, 56.)
Applicant has not used Edibles since May 2019, the month of his 2019 Interview.
During the period when he was unable to sleep, Applicant did not consider the option of
seeing a doctor at a 24-hour healthcare facility. Applicant believed that was not a viable
option  because  he  assumed  that this type  of doctor  would tell  him  to  take  Tylenol  for  his
pain.  He did not believe  that an  over the  counter drug  like  Tylenol would be  sufficiently
helpful  for his condition. Applicant  confirmed  at the  hearing  that he  knew  at the  time  he
consumed  the  Edibles  that  it  was not  legal to  do  so  under Federal  law  and  that it  was
against  his employer’s drug  policy. He also confirmed  that he  understood  that at  the  time
of   his  use   of   the   Edibles,  he   was  under  consideration   for   a   security   clearance.   In
explaining   his  thought   process  at  the   time   he   consumed   the   Edibles,   he   provided   a
curious analogy  between  marijuana  and  alcohol, stating  that they  have  “pretty  much  the
same  restrictions” and  both  are  “controlled.”  He made  the  same  point in his post-hearing
submission  (AE  A), writing  that:  “edibles are available to  the  general public in an  over the
counter fashion  just  like  alcohol.” He noted at  both the hearing  and  repeated  in  AE  A  his
wife  had  leftover prescription  pain medication  and  that  he  chose  not to  take  the  medication
since  the  prescription  was not written  for him. He commented  in AE  A  that “prescription
pain killers are controlled  substances that are  not publicly  available in  an  over the  counter
fashion, like  alcohol.” He argued  that he  made  the  better choice by  using  Edibles, not the
leftover pills, to  relieve  his pain.  Applicant was unaware at the  hearing  that  marijuana  is
a Schedule I  controlled  substance  under the  Federal  Controlled   Substances Act, even
though,  as  noted,  he  knew  that  marijuana  was illegal under Federal  law. (Tr. at 45, 48-
50, 54-56; AE A  at 2.)
1.b  –  Expressed intent to  continue  using marijuana  in the  future  –  In his 2019
Interview, Applicant also made the statement that he may consider taking Edibles in the
future if needed for pain. He advised that he was going to see his doctor in the near future
and  to  get a  “note” for  using  Edibles. In response to the Government’s  interrogatories,
Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to  correct  any  errors  in  the  report  of  his  2019
Interview, and he made a number of corrections. None of his corrections addressed his
comments about his intention to use Edibles in the future. (GE 2 at 9, 18-20.)
In his Answer, Applicant explained that his comment about future use made during
his 2019 Interview was made “with the caveat of only under extreme circumstances, such
as having not slept for upwards of 72 hours, and only in the event of a delay in interacting
with my primary care physician to help resolve the problem.” He wrote further:
Since the time of my interview no further use has occurred as my primary
care physician was able to see me in a very expedited manner and begin
addressing the problem.
Answer at 1.  In  his  Supplemental Answer, Applicant specifically  answered  SOR allegation
in subparagraph  1.b  by  stating: “I deny  that  I  have  intent to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.”
(Supplemental Answer at 1.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  discussed  further  the  “note”  he  wanted  his  doctor  to
provide, which he discussed in his 2019 Interview. He explained that he wanted the doctor
to write “something to state that it was a pertinent solution to the immediate problem,” that
being his lack of sleep due to shoulder pain. He explained further that the note  should
address  that  Applicant’s  use  of  edibles  was  “a  last-minute  desperate  solution  to  an
impossible   problem.”   He  did  not   provide   such   a   note   from   his  doctor  or  any   doctor.
Applicant no  longer believes that he  will ever  use  an  illegal drug  again because  he  has
his shoulder pain  under control with  medications, when  needed.  He also  reaffirmed  his
denial of  the  allegation  regarding  future  intent  to  use  illegal drugs. (Tr. at 47, 50-51, 56-
60.)
During closing argument, Applicant and I engaged in a lengthy discussion about
his failure to provide a signed statement pursuant to AG ¶ 20(b)(3) that set forth both his
intent to abstain from using illegal drugs in the future and an acknowledgment that any
future  drug  use  by  him  would  be  grounds  for  the  revocation  of  his  national  security
eligibility.  He  said  he  did  not  submit  such  a  statement  because  he  expected  the
Government to provide him with an appropriate form for that purpose. After the hearing,
he provided a signed statement of his intent to abstain from any future drug use. He also
wrote: “Additionally, I do understand that these infractions are grounds for revocations of
security clearances issued by the U.S. government.” (Tr. at 105-111; AE C.)
Paragraph 2, Guideline M, Use of Information Technology
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in the one subparagraph of the
SOR under this guideline. The specific facts regarding this allegation are as follows:
2.a  –  Purchase and use in August 2015 of an external USB WiFi card –
Applicant answered the following question in his SCA in the affirmative:
Section 27- Use of Information Technology Systems
Unauthorized Access
In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  illegally  or  without  proper
authorization accessed or attempted to access any information technology
system?
In response to the follow-up questions in his SCA, Applicant disclosed that in August 2015
he “purchased an external USB WiFi card while at Defcon [sic] and have been learning
how to use Kali Linux.”
At his 2016 Interview, Applicant discussed  the above admission in his SCA. He
stated that in addition to the two items described, he also purchased a directional antenna.
He  said  that  these  items  are  typically  used  to  break  into  password-protected  wireless
internet networks. The antenna can be aimed to receive WiFi signals as far away as two
miles. He explained that Kali Linux is software used to overcome password protection on
WiFi  systems.  He  admitted  that  the  unauthorized  entry  of  a  secure  computer  system
would be a violation of law. He has never tried to access the WiFi system of a corporate
computer system.  He has  only attempted  to  enter WiFi  systems  that  appear to  him  to
belong to individuals. He believed that entering the network of a private party would be a
lesser violation of secularity restrictions. In response to a separate question in DOHA’s
interrogatories, he acknowledged as correct the following statement:
1. In  August 2015, you  purchased  an  external USB  WiFi card and  have  used
it at  various [he  corrected  the  word “various” by  inserting  “1 (one)”]  locations
attempting to break into password protected  wireless internet networks.
He then advised that his attempts  using his hacking equipment  were never successful
and that his last attempt was made in August 2015. (GE 2 at 15-16, 24.)
Applicant also reported in his 2016 Interview that he has taken the equipment to
parties at homes of his friends and has allowed them to use the equipment. He said he
does not recall if any of his friends were able to enter a secure WiFi network, but he was
not certain of that. (GE 2 at 15.)
In his October 21, 2019 responses to DOHA’s interrogatories, Applicant was given
the  opportunity  to  correct  any  errors  in  the  reports  summarizing  his  2016  and  2019
Interviews. He made a few minor corrections, but made no changes to the portions of the
2016 Interview report summarized above. He then affirmed that the interview summaries
attached to the Interrogatories were accurate as corrected and adopted the statements.
He signed his interrogatory responses before a Notary Public. (GE 2 at 4, 25-26
At the hearing, Applicant provided extensive testimony about  his involvement in
DEFCON  and  his purchase  and  use of  the hacking  equipment.  Applicant  and  his wife
have attended an annual IT security conference call DEFCON since 2010 or 2011. They
became  volunteer  staff  members  of  DEFCON  in  about  2015.  The  conference  is  an
important  venue  for  IT  security  professionals  to  stay  current  on  developments  in  their
field.  (Tr. at 29-33.)
Applicant  testified  that  in  2015,  at  the  DEFCON  conference  in  Las  Vegas,  he
purchased an external USB WiFi card, which gets plugged into a computer and can be
used to identify WiFi networks available in the area for connection. He explained that all
computers and phones use an internal WiFi card to perform this function. The external
card he bought not only has a USB connection to connect to a computer, it also has an
antenna port that is used to connect to an external antenna. That is the only difference of
the external WiFi card he purchased. The card he purchased came with an antenna. As
a staff member of DEFCON, he purchased the equipment at a discounted price. With the
addition  of  an  antenna,  he  is  able  to  conduct  a  directional  search  for  available  WiFi
networks.  He  testified  that  he  purchased  the  equipment  for  “continuing  education.”
Quoting  Sun  Tzu,  he  wanted  to  “know  thy  enemy,”  meaning  that  he  wanted  to  better
understand the capabilities of hackers who use this type of hacking equipment to break
into computer networks. He wanted to use the hacking equipment to see if he could gain
access  to  password  protected  networks.  To  get  through  a  password  protection  WiFi
network, he  needed  to download  a  “suite” of software called  Kali Linux and  use  one  of
the programs in the suite. (Tr. at 62-71.)
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  never  successful  hacking  into  a  password
protected network with his hacking tools and software. In the process of trying, he was
learning  how  the  tools  work.  He  blamed  his  lack  of  success  on  his  lack  of  expertise
working  with  Linux  software.  He  attempted  to  use  the  tools  at  his  apartment  after  the
conference. The antenna had a stated range of two miles, but Applicant explained that
the quality of the data transmission was poor at longer distances. His next-door neighbor’s
WiFi  network  would  certainly  be  within  reach  of  the  antenna  and  software.  He  initially
claimed he used the hacking tools over a day or two, but then he immediately modified
this statement saying he limited his use to one time for 30-45 minutes before dinner time.
When asked if he had used the hacking equipment since that time, he responded: “Not
to my recollection.” He also limited the target networks into which he sought to gain entry.
He  testified  that  he  only  “picked  something  that  said  ‘guest.’”  Subsequently,  Applicant
tried to explain what he meant by the word “guest” as something different than a business
owned and managed WiFi system. In his post-hearing submission, he repeated his claim
that he only “selected for testing networks containing ‘Guest’ in their SSID [Service Set
Identifier  or  wireless  network  name],”  and  he  did  “not  believe  .  .  .  [that]  would  be
considered  problematic.”  He  also  repeated  his  position  that  his activities  were  merely
self-education in matters “that are used for nefarious activities.”  He was simply “striving
to maintain a sufficient level of education to improve this facet of my IT responsibilities.”
(Tr. at 72-76, 78, 86-90, 93; AE A at 1.)
Applicant  also  testified  that  his  self-education  with  the  hacking  equipment  was
never a part of any work-related project for his employer. He explained that he is “not part
of that team” that works on accessing password-protected WiFi networks. When asked if
he  understood  the  Government’s  security  concerns  regarding  the  illegality  of  trying  to
access  password-protected  networks  without  authorization,  Applicant  responded,  “I
understand that there is verbiage about it.” When asked if he has any aspirations to be a
hacker, he responded:
“Hacker”  is a  lot  of  different terms  . . .  Everyone is a hacker if  you think
about it. You know, you talk - - at Starbucks, you talk somebody into giving
you, Hey, can you give me an extra shot of espresso, Matt, would you? That
type of thing is hacking.
(Tr. at 80-82.)
Applicant  also  testified  that  most  of  his friends  who  work  in  IT  positions  are  far
more knowledgeable than he is with respect to security matters. He agreed that he “may
have taken [the hacking tools] to a get-together [with his IT friends] once . . . I don’t know
if anyone used it or not.” He then testified “I’m going to assume no one picked it up and
messed with it.” (Tr. at 76-77.)
Applicant was asked if he agrees that accessing password-protected networks is
illegal. He responded as follows:
I would imagine there is something written somewhere about it. As I am not
a lawyer for the EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation], I can’t be much more
specific than that.
He also testified that he sought to limit the targets of his attempted hacking activity. He
said:
I don’t know what the rules are about networks that are labeled as “guest”
that  are  intended  for  guest  access,  that  are  segregated  from  internal
corporate  network  that  actually  contain  pertinent  business  and  financial
data . . . Thus, my decision to pick something that said “guest.”
(Tr. at 77-78.)
Whole-Person Evidence
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  four  character  letters,  which  have  been
marked collectively as AE B. They describe him as trustworthy, dependable, loyal, and a
good friend. His references believe that he is highly professional and a person of integrity.
His performs high-quality work and receives outstanding annual reviews. His most recent
character letter is dated April 2, 2018, from his supervisor at the time. He also produced
a  November  2017  report  from  the  FBI  that  stated  that  it  found  no  record  of  Applicant
having ever been arrested. (AE B at 1-5.)
The   subject   line   of   the   April  2,   2018   character  reference   letter  reads:
“Recommendation   for  military   discharge   characterization   upgrade   for  [Applicant].”  The
conclusion of  the letter in the penultimate paragraph states:
Given  his drive  for excellence  and  superb character, it is  my  professional
recommendation
[Applicant]   have   his  military   discharge
characterization  upgraded  to Honorable.”
that
Applicant provided no evidence as to whether his discharge upgrade petition was granted.
(AE B at 5.)
Applicant testified at length that he has a unique set of skill sets that makes him a
valuable  member of  his  employer’s  team.  Most  of  his colleagues are  experts in  Linux,
while  Applicant  has  a  different  expertise  making  his  skillset  unique.  Much  of  his
technology knowledge is self-taught. (Tr. at 30-34.)

"In  Applicant’s  Answer,  he  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 68 years old. He is married (his third marriage) and has no children
of  his  own.  He  currently  works  for  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has  worked  for
approximately  six  years.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  first  received  a  security
clearance sometime in the 1980s. In 2016, his active security clearance was suspended
by the  Defense  Security Service  (DSS)  for the allegations at  issue in  this hearing.  His
current  employer  is  sponsoring  him  for  his  security  clearance  request.  (Tr.  20,  37-38;
GE 1, 5)
Under  Guideline  D,  the  SOR  alleged  the  following:  (1)  that  Applicant,  between
2001 and 2015, used his company-issued computer to upload, view, and save images
of  naked  women  and  young  girls,  ages  11-15,  in  modeling  poses  and  with  scant
clothing. It also alleged Applicant continues to  view similar images at home on his cell
phone;  (2)  that  in  January  1997,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  sexual
assault and sexual assault on a child while in a position of trust;  and (3) that Applicant
attended  a  12-step  program  for sex addicts  from  2001  to  2016,  but  stopped attending
because his wife did not think it was helping him. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c) I find that SOR ¶ 1.c
does not fall within any of Guideline D’s disqualifying conditions and further find for the
Applicant on this allegation.
Under  Guideline   M,   the   SOR  alleged   the   following:  (1)  that   Applicant  signed
documents  prepared   by   his  employer,  for  whom   he   worked   from   2001   to   2015,  that
prohibited  him  from  using  his company-issued  computer  to  view  any  pornography; and
(2)  that  Applicant,   between   2001   and   2015,  used   his  company-issued   computer  to
upload,  view,  and   save   images  of  naked   women   and   young   girls,  ages  11-15,  in
modeling   poses  and   with   scant  clothing.   It   also  alleged   Applicant  continues  to   view
similar images at home on his cell phone. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b)
Under  Guideline   E,  the   SOR   alleged:   (1)  that  in   February   2015,  Applicant  was
removed  from  his work premises,  had  his work laptop  and  security  badges confiscated
for  violations  of   personal  conduct  and   violations  of   his  company’s  network  information
technology   systems;  (2)  that  in  March  2015,  Applicant  was  terminated   from   his
employment;   (3)  that  Applicant,   between   2001   and   2015,  used   his  company-issued
computer  to  upload, view, and  save  images of  naked  women  and  young  girls, ages 11-
15,  in  modeling   poses   and   with   scant  clothing.   It   also  alleged   Applicant  continues  to
view  similar images at home  on his cell  phone; and  (4) that Applicant signed  documents
prepared  by  his employer, whom  he  worked  for from 2001  to  2015,  that  prohibited  him
from  using his company-issued computer to view any pornography. (SOR ¶¶  3.a-3.c)
In  approximately  1997,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  inappropriately  touching  his
11-year-old stepdaughter. He touched her through her clothing when she was sleeping
(or pretending to sleep). He did this once a week for a month. The child told her mother
(Applicant’s second  wife)  about Applicant’s actions. He admitted  his behavior.  He also
admitted  viewing  images  of  adolescent  girls  ages  11  to  15  in  sexually  erotic  poses
during  this  time.  He  was  arrested  on  felony  charges  of  sexual  assault  on  a  child  and
sexual assault on a child while in a position of trust. He pleaded guilty and was given a
deferred  sentence,  which  included  four  years  of  unsupervised  probation.  He  was  also
ordered to attend treatment by a therapist for four years. He was ordered to register as
a sex offender. He successfully completed his probation, including attending his court-
ordered treatment. He was released from probation and successfully fulfilled the terms
of his deferred sentence in 2001. The original charges were then dropped. From 2001
to  2016,  he  voluntarily  attended  a  12-step  recovery  program  for  sex  addicts.  He
believed the meetings were helpful, but his wife did not, so he stopped attending. He is
no  longer  listed  as  a  sex  offender  in  his  home  state.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
claimed that a therapist gave him a favorable prognosis against reoffending. He did not
offer any records to document of said prognosis or discuss his treatment history. (Tr. 27,
37-38, 40; GE 2, 7; AE C; SOR answer)
From  June  2001  to  March  2015,  Applicant  worked  for  employer  1  (E1)  as  a
software  engineer.  In  his  interview  with  a  defense  investigator  in  July  2019,  Applicant
admitted  that  he  signed  documents  provided  by  E1,  or  E1’s  predecessor  company,
acknowledging  that  he  was  prohibited  from  having  and  viewing  pornography  on  his
company-provided computer. In his hearing testimony, Applicant equivocated this point
stating  that  he  could  not  recall  any  specific  formal  company  policy  regarding  the
personal  use  of  a  company-issued  laptop.  He  also  stated  that  someone  told  him  he
could use his company-issued laptop for personal use, but he could not recall who that
person  was.  I  did  not  find  Applicant’s  testimony  credible.  (Tr.  23,  30,  34;  GE  2;  SOR
answer)
In February 2015, law enforcement became aware that Applicant may have  had
child  pornography  on  his  company-issued  laptop.  In  October  2015,  Applicant’s  work
laptop  was  seized  and  examined  by  law  enforcement  forensic  examiners.  The
examination  concluded  that  the  material  found  on  the  computer  was  not  child
pornography, but rather child erotica (adolescent children posed in erotic positions  with
skimpy  and/or  revealing  clothing).  Possessing  child  erotica  on  a  computer  does  not
violate  any  state  law  where  Applicant  was  located.  The  criminal  investigation  was
closed.  Applicant  admitted  have  adult  pornography  on  his  employer-provided  laptop.
(Tr. 28; GE 2, 8)
In  February 2015, Applicant’s employer put him  on administrative  leave  pending
the criminal investigation  into his alleged  computer misuse.  In  March  2015, due to the
uncertainty  of  his  computer  activities,  his  employment  was  terminated  with  E1  and  he
was directed to return all the government and E1 property issued to him. In April 2016,
he received notification from the DSS that his security clearance was suspended based
on information obtained by DOD regarding his sexual behavior and criminal conduct. In
his  SOR  answer,  he  admitted  using  his  company-issued  laptop  to  view,  upload,  and
save  images of  naked women and  scantily dressed young girls (ages  11-15) posed in
erotic  positions.  He  also  admitted  signing  company  documents  prohibiting  him  from
using his company-laptop for these purposes. (Tr. 23-24, 28-29, 34-35; GE 2, 4, 5; SOR
answer)
Applicant denied using his current company-issued computer to view, download,
or  save  any  type  of  pornographic  material.  He  documented  that  he  has  no  criminal
record  in  his  home  state,  other  than  the  1997  child  sexual  abuse  crime.  He  admitted
that  he  continues  to  view  child  erotica  on  his  personal  electronic  devices.  He  viewed
these types of images as recently as a month before his security clearance hearing. He
continues to view this material because he is sexually stimulated by viewing images of
scantily dressed  girls,  ages  11  to  15,  in  modeling  poses.  He  admitted  that  his  actions
show questionable judgment on his part. (Tr. 24-26, 28-29, 34-36; GE 2; AE B
Applicant  presented  several  “U  Rock”  awards  from  his  current  employer

Use of Information Technology/Handling Protected Information
The  concerns  identified  under  these  Guidelines  are  listed  as  four  separate
allegations and are discussed below in order as listed in the SOR.
SOR  ¶  1.a  –  Alleged  that  Applicant  created  an  unclassified  presentation  that
contained  classified  information,  accessed  the  presentation  on  two  or  more  company
computers, and when questioned by his company security office, he only informed them
of one computer.
Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  with  explanation.  In  June  2016,  Applicant
created  and  saved  “with  some  assistance  from  other  colleagues”  an  unclassified
presentation on a company unclassified shared drive. He took “great care to ensure that
the  entire  presentation  was  unclassified.”  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  17,  42-43)  Multiple
company  employees  used  Applicant’s  presentation  and  saved  it  in  an  unclassified
network  drive.  One  of those  employees thought  there was  some  classified  information
on the presentation. (SOR Answer; Tr. 17-18)
Applicant  accessed  the  presentation  on  three  different  company  computers  by
navigating to the link on the network drive and opening that link. The presentation was
stored on the network drive. (Tr. 18) When questioned by the security office, Applicant
was asked where he stored the presentation and he informed them that he stored it on
the  network  drive.  The  presentation  was  not  stored  on  more  than  one  computer.
However,  any  computer  connected  to  the  network  drive  could  access  it.  (Tr.  18-19)
Applicant  stated  that  the  presentation  did  not  contain  any  classified  information.
Applicant  knows  that to  be  true because he reviewed  the information  with  the security
office,  along  with  the  Security  Classification  Guide  for  the  program.  Applicant  and  the
security office agreed that the information in question was not classified. (Tr. 19-20)
Applicant did not actually download or save the presentation onto any computer.
Rather, he had created the presentation on his own computer and saved it only on an
unclassified shared drive. (SOR Answer) When asked by the security office whether the
presentation was on any other computers, Applicant perceived this question to relate to
only  the  downloading  and  saving  of  the  presentation  to  a  computer,  not  the  mere
accessing  of  the  presentation  on  the  shared  drive  via  a  computer.  Therefore,  he
answered in the negative, even though he had accessed the presentation on the shared

misunderstanding and interpreted the security office’s inquiry in the literal sense. (SOR
Answer)
total  of
Applicant  stated  that  he  never  attempted  to  conceal  the  fact  that  he  had
accessed the presentation on three separate computers. He advised the security office
that  the  presentation  was  saved  to  an  unclassified  shared  drive,  and  therefore  would
have  been  accessible  by  multiple  users  from  any  network-connected  drive.  Applicant
was  well  aware  that  the  company’s  computer  security  officials  could  easily  and
immediately determine all users and/or devices that had accessed the presentation after
it was saved to the unclassified shared drive. (SOR Answer)
The  security  office  and  Applicant  noted  that  the  questioned  material  had  been
publicly  released  and  was  readily  accessible  through  open  sources  in  the  public
domain.  Applicant  received  no  follow-up  from  the  security  office  on  this  matter.  His
computer  was  returned  to  him.  He  was  not  cited  for  a  security  infraction.  Applicant’s
presentation still remains on the company unclassified shared drive, where he originally
saved it. (SOR Answer; Tr. 53-55)
Applicant  accessed  this  presentation  on  more  than  one  company  computer
because  the  presentation  was  stored  on  a  server.  Sometimes,  he  would  not  be  at  his
normal workstation and when he found himself at different locations, he would pull the
presentation  from  the  server  and  review it.  (Tr.  22)  As  a  take  away  from  this  incident,
Applicant  has  vowed  to  read  the  Security  Classification  Guide  as  the  first  order  of
business  before  working  on  a  particular  new  program.  In  a  typical  year,  Applicant
creates “[t]housands probably” of presentations. (Tr. 20-21)
SOR ¶ 1.b – Alleged that Applicant used a colleague’s account to access a DoD
classified system after his account had lapsed.
Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  with  explanation.  On  infrequent  occasions,
Applicant  visited  the  company  lab  without  having  first  obtaining  a  current  group
password (i.e. the former group password has expired and Applicant had not yet gone
through the administrative process to obtain the new one). Applicant was unsure of the
exact  date  when  this  occurred,  and  on  cross-examination  settled  on  the  approximate
date of 2013. On these infrequent occasions, a company colleague would log in to the
group account on Applicant’s behalf. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-23, 25, 42-43)
The lab environment involved multiple cleared individuals who typically shared a
computer or  computers  in  a  secure  place. The  practice  of  one  person  logging  on  with
the current group password and others doing the same was relatively common and  an
accepted practice of his coworkers. The Director of Integration and Testing, a company
colleague of Applicant, provided the following about the group account access practices
in the lab:
I worked  with  [Applicant]  on  the [program] from  2008-2017. [Applicant]  had
the clearance  and the  need to know to view classified data associated with
the   system.  The   program   has  many   different  computer  accounts  and
systems.  Many   of   the   computer  labs  had   shared   computers.  Employees
were  responsible   for  ensuring   they   kept  the   accounts  up   to   date   and
remembering   the   latest  group   account password.  Our satellite   integration
and  test  occurred  at  an  offsite  customer facility. For people  in managerial
roles  and   travelers  to   our  site,   like   [Applicant],   that  only   used   these
systems  occasionally;  it  was  not  unusual   to   have   their   account  or
password  not   be  up   to   date.   In   these   labs   with   shared   computers,   it  was
not  unusual  for  one   person   to   login  on   a   group   account  or  their   account
and  have  another person  access or view  test data  (while  the  user  was in
the   room).  This  was  considered   acceptable   as   long   as  the   person   was
cleared,   had   need   to   know   and   was  authorized   to   view   the   data.   (SOR
Answer (Tab D))
Applicant reiterated what Director of Integration and testing stated above during
his  testimony.  (Tr.  23-24)  Applicant  understands  that  password  sharing  of  the  sort
mentioned  above  is  not  permitted  and  inappropriate,  even  in  a  group  password  and
group account environment. He pledged to obtain and use a current group password on
visits to the company lab on all future occasions. He understands clearly that he must
personally obtain a current group password, and that it is improper for a colleague to log
into a group account on his behalf. Of note, there was an identical group password for
all users of the group account. At all times in question, Applicant was eligible to obtain
the  group  password  renewals.  He  held  the  proper  clearance  to  access  the  group
account, and always had the need to know. (SOR Answer; Tr. 25-26)
SOR  ¶  1.c  –  Alleged  that  Applicant  used  classified  material  that  was  removed
without  approval,  and  saved  the  product  in  two  locations  on  an  unclassified  company
server. He did not report this incident to company security.
Applicant  denied   this  allegation   with   explanation.  He  explained   that  a   cleared
colleague   (CC)   strictly   followed   all   protocol  and   procedures  for  the   transfer  of
unclassified   data   from  a   classified   system   (high   side)  to   an   unclassified   system   (low
side). He  properly  exported  the  data  from  the  high  side  to  the  low  side, where he  saved
it. (SOR Answer; Tr.  26-27) Applicant  was unsure of the  timeframe  when  this occurred,
stating   it  was  “around   2013   maybe.  But  since   it’s  been   so   long,  I   don’t  remember  the
exact  year. It was before 2015.” (Tr. 30, 44)
After the  data  had  been  exported  to  the  low  side, Applicant included  a  portion  of
it  in  two   presentations  he   created   and   saved   on   an   unclassified   company   computer.
When   CC   reviewed   Applicant’s   presentation,  he   recommended   that  Applicant  delete   a
small portion of it. CC knew the entire presentation was unclassified, but he believed the
audience  seeing  the  presentation  might erroneously  believe  that  the  small  portion  was
classified,  and  he  did not want to  take  presentation  time  to  explain  why  the  material was
unclassified.  Applicant  deleted   the   small   portion   of   the   presentation,  per  CC’s
suggestion. (SOR Answer; Tr. 27-29)  CC states as follows:
I worked  with  [Applicant]  in  the  support  of a  program  in  which we  analyzed
performance   data   of   an   electronics  unit  in   the   2014   to   2016   time   frame
that  was  saved   on   a   classified   system.  The   performance   data   was
unclassified.   OPSEC  CONOPs  was  followed   correctly   to   remove   the
unclassified   data   from   the   system.   We   were  allowed   to   print   unclassified
plots, stamp   them   “UNCLASS” and   take  them  outside  the   classified  labs.
The  data  was unclassified  when  removed  from  the  lab. Out of  abundance
of   caution,  additional  security   guidelines  were  taken   into   account  as  we
prepared   the   plots  of  the   data   for  presentation.   The   data   was  already
unclassified,  but  this  additional  step   made   it  more  obvious  the   data   was
unclassified,  allowing   the   presentation   to   be   made   without  having   to
explain why the data was unclassified. (SOR Answer (Tab D))
As  the  above  evidence  indicates,  no  security  violation  occurred  that  required
making  a  report  to  company  security.  Applicant  stated  that  even  though  he  did  not
compromise any classified information  and did not violate any policies, there is always
more  one  can  do  when  it  comes  to  security  and  protecting  classified  information.  It  is
better  to  be  even  more  “hyper-vigilant”  and  take  every  possible  precaution  when  it
comes to protecting classified information. (Tr. 29-39)
SOR  ¶   1.d   –   Alleged   that   between   about  2009   to   at  least   2016   Applicant
accessed   a   Government  computer  system   without  authorization   once   or  twice  a   year.
He had  “viewing  privileges” only  so  he  circumvented  this  by  downloading  test data  to  a
computer he  was not authorized  to  access and  then  having  a  colleague  transfer data  to
his computer. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant  denied  this  allegation  with  explanation.  He  explained  the  situation
described in the SOR is not an altogether accurate depiction of the facts. Similar to the
situation described in SOR ¶ 1.b, above., Applicant held the proper clearance to access
the  classified  systems  in  question.  He  was  also  eligible  to  obtain  an  updated  group
password. However, he had not gone through the administrative process to obtain the
most recent group password for the group accounts involved. In this instance, Applicant
was  visiting  a  company  site  in  another  city,  and  the  person  responsible  for  providing
updated passwords  was  absent  from  the  office  on  the  day  in  question.  (SOR  Answer;
Tr. 30-31)
The testing data involved in this situation was unclassified.  Applicant needed to
perform data analysis on the relevant unclassified testing data. The unclassified testing
data  resided  on  the  “first classified  system,” but this system  did  not offer the analytical
tools  Applicant  needed  to  properly  process  the  data.  A  “second  classified  system”
offered these tools. (SOR Answer) Applicant asked his colleague to transfer the relevant
unclassified testing data from the “first classified system” (the one without the analytical
tools he needed) to the “second classified system” (the one with the analytical tools he
needed). This  transfer did  not  require  Applicant  to  access  the  “first  classified  system,”
and he did not do so. Once the unclassified testing data was transferred to the “second
classified  system,”  Applicant  performed  analysis  using  the  tools  offered  by  “second
classified system.” (SOR Answer; Tr. 31)
Applicant  was  properly  cleared  to  access  both  the  “first  classified  system”  and
the  “second  classified  system.”  However,  he  had  not  administratively  obtained  an
updated  group  password  for  either  system.  His  colleague  logged  on  to  the  “second
classified  system”  on  his  behalf,  so  that  Applicant  could  access  and  analyze  the
unclassified  testing  data  that  had  been  transferred  from  the  “first  classified  system.”
(SOR Answer; Tr. 32) The allegation that Applicant accessed a Government computer
system  without  authorization  once  or  twice  a  year  is  not  true,  because  Applicant  was
cleared and had a need to know that information. (Tr. 32)
The  “second  classified  system”  was  not  Applicant’s  computer,  as  stated  in  the
SOR. The  two  “systems” were not computers, but rather they were  group  accounts on
classified  systems  accessible  via  a  current  group  password.  (SOR  Answer)  Applicant
performed  analysis  of  the  unclassified  testing  data  on  the  “second  classified  system.”
He  did  not  remove  any  of  the  unclassified  testing  data  from  the  “second  classified
system”  when  he  did  so.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  32-34)  Applicant  has  not  had  a  similar
situation occur like this “since 2016.” (Tr. 33) Applicant learned as a take away from this
event  that  everyone  allowed  into  the  facility  would  be  required  to  know  the  group
username  and  password  as  an  additional  safeguard  to  protect  classified  information.
(Tr. 34-35)
Applicant reiterated throughout his testimony that these incidents have instilled in
him  a  heightened  sense  of  security  awareness.  (Tr.  20-22,  29,  34-35)  Applicant  has
since  taken  numerous  security  training  courses,  and  submitted  seven  certificates  of
completion for various security training courses. (Tr. 21, 35-36, 38; AE O)
The Government cross-alleged the use of information technology concern raised
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  as  an  additional  handling  protected  information  allegation
under  SOR  ¶  2.a.  The  facts  and  mitigation  discussed  under  use  of  information
technology are applicable to the handling protected information concern.
To summarize and clarify, the last time Applicant engaged in any type of “similar
incidents  was  “about  2016,”  approximately  five  years  before  his  hearing  date.  (Tr.  36)
Applicant stated that he never engaged in behavior that resulted in the compromise of
classified material.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant’s  company  never found  that he  failed  to  properly
follow  its  policies,  regulations,  procedures,  or  mishandled  classified  material.  (Tr.  36)
Nor  did  his  company  find  that  Applicant  misused  any  information  technology.  (Tr.  37)
Furthermore, Applicant’s company never determined that he lied or lacked candor when
explaining or discussing these events with them. (Tr. 37) None of these SOR allegations
led to Applicant being disciplined by his company. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  has  since  taken  a  behavior  modification  course  following  these
incidents  to  avoid  making  similar  mistakes  in  the  future.  He  learned  how  one’s
personality  can  effect  one’s  behavior.  He  realized  that  his  persona  is  very  “task
oriented” and  “goal oriented,” which resulted in him being more focused on getting the
job  done.  He  recognizes  that  he  must  remain  “more  hyper-vigilant”  when  it  comes  to
using security precautions and avoid lapses such as not taking the proper care to know
his password. (Tr. 37-38) Applicant submitted a Certificate of Completion dated April 18,
2021,  to  document  his  having  completed  a  four-hour  behavior  modification  class  and
passing a written knowledge assessment. (AE N)
Non-Alleged Conduct
Applicant  was  denied  clearances  in  2004,  2006,  2008,  and  2018.  In  2009,
Applicant was granted a clearance. His most recent SF-86 was dated February 3, 2018,
and  was  his  ten-year  renewal  application  for  that  2009  clearance.  However,  while
holding that clearance, at the request of his employer, Applicant applied for eligibility to
access sensitive compartmented information (SCI). This SCI access was on a restricted
customer  project  in  Another  Government  Agency  (AGA).  The  AGA  denied  Applicant’s
access  to  SCI,  and  on  April  2,  2018,  notified  him  by  letter  identifying  the  reasons  for
their denial. (Tr. 45-49, 52; GE 1, GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant’s  2004,  2006,  and  2008  denials  appear  to  have  been  based  primarily
on  minimizing  his  high  school  illegal  drug  use.  (Tr.  39-40)  As  noted,  the  CAF  granted
Applicant’s clearance in 2009. Presumably, his 2004, 2006, and 2008 clearance denials
were reviewed when the CAF granted his 2009 clearance.
Applicant’s 2018 access to SCI AGA denial addressed issues involving personal
conduct.  He  completed  a  January  17,  2019  statement  to  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  that  discussed  the  personal  conduct  issues  after  submitting  his
February 3, 2018 SF-86. (Tr. 45-48; GE 3, GE 4)
During  cross-examination,  Department  Counsel  queried  Applicant  regarding
those  personal  conduct  issues.  Applicant  provided  an  answer  that  mirrored  the
information  he  provided  in  his  January  17,  2019  OPM  statement,  and  Department
Counsel moved to amend the SOR adding a Guideline E (personal conduct) concern. I
denied  Department  Counsel  motion  to  amend.  See  Transcript  for  further  details  and
Analysis section below. (Tr. 49-51, 55-56)
Character Evidence
A summary of Applicant’s closing comments follows. He recognizes the value of
information  security  and  is  very  grateful  to  have  his  current  job  and  career.  He  takes
great satisfaction in having spent the last 18 years of his professional life contributing to
the  security  of  the  United  States.  He  takes  information  security  very  seriously  and
realizes  that  he  could  have  done  better. With  the  benefit  of  hindsight  and  training,  he
realizes  the importance  of adhering to security regulations  rather than relying on  good
intentions.  He  committed  to  take  whatever  additional  steps  are  required  to  avoid  any
compromise of classified material if granted a clearance. (Tr. 40-41)
Applicant  submitted  four  character  letters,  all  from  company  employees  who
have  known  him  for  lengthy  periods  of  time.  They  attested  to  his  good  character  and
trustworthiness  and  had  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  SOR  allegations.  They  support
reinstatement  of  his  clearance.  (SOR  Answer;  AE  D)  Applicant’s  most  recent
performance review form the calendar year 2019 ranks him  as a  “Top  Performer,”  and
documents  significant  contributions  to  his  company  and  the  national  defense.  (SOR
Answer;  AE  E,  AE  K)  He  submitted  11  Certificates  of  Achievement  in  recognition  of
professional accomplishments over the past several years. His numerous awards from
his  company  recognized  him  for  contributing  to  programs  advancing  national  security,
technology, and civil needs. (SOR Answer; AE F, AE J, AE L) Applicant is active in his
community,  coaching  his  children’s  sporting  events  and  volunteering  for  civic  events
sponsored by his city of residence. (AE M)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January 2,
1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG),  which  became
effective on June 8, 2017.
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
the
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially
for  a  security  clearance,
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in
conjunction  with  the  factors  listed  in  AG  ¶  2,  describing  the  adjudicative  process.  The
administrative
impartial,  and
commonsense  decision.  According to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is a  conscientious
scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The
administrative  judge  must  consider all available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.
judge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal
is  a
fair,
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national  security
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The
applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance
decision.
the  Government  predicated  upon
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship  with
trust  and  confidence.  This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be  “in  terms of the
national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).
Guideline M, Use of Information Technology
",True
"As  to  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a,  and  the  cross-allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.b),
Applicant  admitted  that  his  employment  was  terminated  as  alleged,  but  he  otherwise
denied the allegations. He denied the allegation at SOR ¶ 3.b. His answers also included
narrative explanations. Applicant’s admissions and explanations are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  65  years old. He and his second wife married in 1991. She moved
across the country to take a new job in summer 2011; he filed for divorce in June 2012,
and moved out of the marital home soon thereafter. (AE A at ¶ 16; Tr. 26, 76-77, 105-106)
They divorced in September 2014. (GE 1 at 22-23; Tr. 75-76) Applicant remarried in June
2017. (GE 1 at 21)
Applicant has a master’s degree and a Ph.D., both in nuclear engineering. (Tr. 24)
He has been employed in the defense industry, with security clearances, for most of the
last 35 years, since at least 1987. (GE 1 at 14-17, 53-54, Tr. 25) He said he did not hold a
clearance at the time of the hearing. (Tr. 8)
From 2002 until May 2017 when he was terminated, Applicant worked for company
1. At the time, Applicant was the company’s chief strategy and technology officer, as well
as acting senior vice president and general manager. (GE 1; Tr. 98) Applicant has worked
for his current employer since July 2018, and is now the chief operating officer. (GE 1 at
14; Tr. 102)
In September 2015, company 1 was acquired by a venture capital firm. A month
later, half of Applicant’s responsibilities were re-organized under someone else. He came
to believe he was being undermined. In January 2016, Applicant refused to sign an annual
ethics certification because he believed the business plan submitted to the venture capital
firm was inaccurate. The company’s general counsel, Mr. F., requested that Applicant file a
confidential ethics complaint. The company’s human resources (HR) director nonetheless
soon learned about it. (AE A at ¶¶ 20-28; Tr. 29-31)
Applicant then offered his resignation but was soon promoted to chief strategy and
technology officer, with primary responsibility for company 1’s business with the U.S. Navy.
AE A at ¶¶ 29-31; Tr. 72-73, 103) At the height of his responsibilities, Applicant had 900
full-time and part-time employees. (Tr. 74) In the process, another employee, Mr. C, was
demoted, and Applicant became Mr. C’s supervisor. (AE A at ¶ 34; Tr. 31-32) For the next
several  months,  Applicant  had  a  dispute  with  his  superiors  over  the  fairness  of  his
performance bonus and salary increase, especially compared with Mr. C. He also sought to
remove Mr. C due to ethics violations and sexual harassment complaints against Mr. C
made by female employees. (AE A at ¶¶ 34-50; Tr. 32-36)
In  May  2017,  company  1  conducted  an  investigation  into  Applicant’s  workplace
conduct, including a romantic relationship with a subordinate employee in Applicant’s chain
of command, and the company’s discovery that Applicant had accessed and downloaded
an extensive collection of pornography on company computer systems. (GE 4) This alleged
conduct, as detailed in GE 4, is the basis for the allegations and cross-allegations in the
SOR. The Government offered GE 4 with redactions, as they received it from company 1.
(Tr. 18)
Government Exhibit 4 was prepared by company 1’s general counsel, Mr. F. Review
of  the  report  indicates  that  the  investigation  was  initiated  when  Mr.  F  learned  of  the
relationship between Applicant and the subordinate employee in 2017, after the employee
raised concerns about working for Applicant, given their prior romantic involvement. (GE 4
at 2)
The company’s investigation concluded that Applicant had pursued and engaged in
a long-term relationship with a subordinate employee through early 2016. The report noted
that e-mails between Applicant and the employee also showed at various points that he
expressed his love for her, pressed her to commit to him, and provided her gifts, such as
flowers  and  jewelry.  (GE  4  at  4)  The  company  concluded  that  he  did  not  report  the
relationship  to  the  company,  and  did  not  take  other  steps  to  mitigate  any  risks  to  the
company,  such  as  potential  claims  of  sexual  harassment  or  a  hostile  workplace
environment, or favoritism towards the subordinate employee in the promotion process,
either real or perceived. (GE 4 at 1-2, 4)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  between  August  and  December  2012,  he  had  a
consensual sexual relationship with S, an administrative assistant at company 1. He said S
reported to a manager who reported to Applicant. He said that S initiated the relationship.
He said the sexual relationship lasted between August and December 2012, and did not
resume after that. (AE A at ¶ 2-3; Tr. 26, 48, 77-78, 81-82, 84, 104-105)
Applicant said that he was never S’s direct supervisor, but he said he approved
promotions or raises recommended to him by her direct supervisor. (AE A at ¶ 14; Tr. 27,
49, 79-81) Applicant said that S remained in his chain of command until he was promoted
out  of  the  organization.  (Tr.  50)  He  is  not  aware  of  a  company  1  policy  prohibiting  a
romantic relationship such as between himself and S. (Tr. 89)
Applicant  said  he  confirmed  the  relationship  to  company  1’s  human  resources
director in 2013 once he was asked about it. He said that that the CEO told him that he
should not have mentioned the relationship to a former company 1 employee, but that the
company took no disciplinary action against Applicant at the time. (AE A at ¶¶ 4-7; Tr. 27,
52-53, 81, 103-104)
To separate himself from S, Applicant moved to another branch office in the area for
about nine months; he also moved to another area office on two occasions, also to avoid
S. Applicant testified that their sexual relationship did not extend beyond late 2012, though
he  said  that  both  parties  later  sought  to  renew  the  relationship,  for  different  reasons,
between 2013 and 2015. Applicant testified that he wanted a more public relationship, and
while she at times sought to renew their affair, she wished to remain married. (AE A at ¶¶
8-13; Tr. 28, 52-54, 81-86, 106-111)
Applicant and his third wife met online in about 2015, became serious by early 2016
and married in 2017. (Tr. 89-90) They now live in a state across the country from where
Applicant lived when he was at company 1, and are happily married. Applicant regrets the
relationship with S and says there is no chance it will recur. (Tr. 47)
The rest of GE 4 concerns company 1’s discovery that Applicant had downloaded,
accessed, or stored “an extensive collection of pornography” on company-owned computer
systems. Mr. F reported that on Tuesday, May 2, 2017, he entered Applicant’s office during
normal business hours while Applicant was travelling and found an external hard drive
(EHD) on Applicant’s desk. The report indicates that Mr. F opened the drive and viewed, or
attempted to view, its contents. (GE 4 at 2)
In GE 4, Mr. F reported that the contents of three directories on the drive included
over 100 playlists and over 100 video clips, saved to the directory in 2009 or 2010, many
with sexually suggestive file names, as well as several hundred files, in Microsoft Word or
Acrobat PDF format, some of an “explicit sexual nature,” saved to the directory between
2007 and 2012. (GE 4 at 2-3)
The report indicates that Mr. F found these materials on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (GE
4 at 2) The report also indicates that “based on these preliminary findings, on Monday, May
1, 2017, [sic] [Mr. F] asked the IT department to remotely access Applicant’s [company 1-
provided] computer” for additional evidence of risk to the company. (GE 4 at 3) (In seeking
to undermine GE 4. Applicant and his counsel drew attention to this date discrepancy,
noting that Mr. F could not have sought assistance from the IT department the day before
he found the inappropriate materials on the EHD. This date discrepancy is unexplained)
On May 3, 2017, Company 1’s IT department notified Mr. F that they had found 50
gigabytes of “suspect video and movie files” found to contain file names suggesting they
contained pornographic images, videos, and documents. Later that day, they notified Mr. F
that “the offending files had been deleted by someone.” The IT department also found a
spreadsheet titled “Recent Downloads list 4-8-17” and a document detailing Applicant’s
personal account information for his membership on an adult website, sent to his personal
e-mail address. Mr. F printed the spreadsheet, which identified 280 unique files, identified
by words and descriptors that “strongly suggest the existence of hardcore pornography.”
GE 4 at 3) According to GE 4, a review of Applicant’s e-mail files also showed that from his
company account to his personal email, he sent “a 50-page document titled ‘movielist.txt’
that identified the contents of an additional portable device containing more than 1,300
files,” many with file names containing explicit pornographic terms. (GE 4 at 4) The memo
from Mr. F is in the record (GE 4), but the underlying computer data is not.
Company 1’s internet policy prohibited “browsing explicit pornographic . . . or other
sites determined to be inappropriate” and “posting, sending, or acquiring sexually explicit or
sexually  oriented  .  .  .  or  other  material  determined  to  be  inappropriate.”  (GE  4  at  4)
Applicant testified that he was “absolutely” aware of that policy, since he had reviewed it,
commented on it, and approved it. (Tr. 97-98)
On May 8, 2017, Applicant attended a morning meeting in a conference room at
company 1’s offices. (Tr. 40) He also had an office there. He believes that, when he left his
office for the meeting, his personal EHD was in his briefcase. (AE A at ¶¶ 60-62; Tr. 40-41)
When Applicant arrived at the meeting, Mr. C was there, though he left the room for 10-15
minutes before coming back. (AE A at ¶ 62; Tr. 41)
Applicant was away from his office all day, until about 6 PM. When he returned, the
company general counsel, Mr. F, and the chief operating officer, Mr. S., entered his office
to talk to him. They told him that a large amount of pornography had been found on his
company tablet. They did not show him evidence of what they had found. AE A at ¶ 65; Tr.
42-43)
Applicant noticed that both his personal EHD and the company EHD were on his
desk. (Tr. 42) He said Mr. F picked up both the personal and company EHD, saw a label
on the personal item and put it down. (Tr. 71, 94) Applicant’s company tablet and company
EHD were seized, but they did not access the personal EHD at that time. (Tr. 71) Applicant
was told he was being placed on administrative leave. He packed his personal items and
was escorted from the building. (AE A at ¶ 65; Tr. 43-44)
The May 13, 2017 company 1 report concluded that “as the senior-most manager
leading a significant share of [company 1’s] business, [Applicant’s] behavior and judgment
sets the wrong example and tone at the top, violates our Policies and Code, and exposes
[company  1]  to  significant  legal  and  reputational  risk.”  (GE  4  at  4)  Mr.  F’s  conclusion,
following  consultation  with  outside  employment  counsel,  was  that  Applicant  should  be
immediately terminated for cause. (GE 4 at 4)
Applicant  was  called  to  a  meeting  on  May  15,  2017,  with  all  of  the  company’s
executive  managers.  Mr.  F  told  him  that  “they  found  a  large  amount  of  pornographic
material on my [company 1] tablet” and that he was being dismissed as a result. (Tr. 44)
Then  and  subsequently,  Applicant  requested  to  be  shown  what  was  found  but  was
rebuffed. (Tr. 45) The record does not include a termination letter from company 1, but it is
reasonable to infer that he was terminated for cause given the findings and conclusions in
in GE 4 and the fact that he was terminated soon thereafter.
Applicant’s termination led to an incident report in the Defense Department’s JPAS.
(GE 3). I therefore infer that he had a clearance at the time, as otherwise an incident report
in JPAS would not have been made.
Applicant testified that company 1 had issued him a Microsoft “tablet” computer, as
well as a company-issued external hard drive (EHD), to back up the tablet and to provide
space for an e-mail archive. The tablet was not suitable for working at home, so he used
his personal computer. He also used a personal EHD to transfer company 1 information
(work files) between his personal home computer and his work tablet. (AE A at ¶¶ 51-55;
Tr. 36-38, 55-58, 96, 107-108)
Applicant’s personal EHD and the company-issued EHD looked alike, so he labeled
the personal EHD as such. (AE A at ¶ 56, Tr. 58) He would connect the personal EHD to
the company tablet only when transferring company data to work on at home, or when
transferring company data back to his company tablet after he did so. Otherwise, he kept
his personal EHD in his briefcase. (AE A at ¶¶ 57-58; Tr. 38-39, 64) He said he was careful
to  delete  proprietary  information  from  both  his  personal  EHD  and  his  personal  home
computer. (Tr. 59)
Applicant testified that he was asked to keep the company EHD at his office and not
“carry  it  around”  because  it  contained  company  proprietary  information.  (Tr.  37)  He
acknowledged transporting the company EHD between his various company workspaces
(he had three offices) but did not take it home or on travel. (Tr. 55-56, 59, 107-108) He was
not comfortable using a “thumb drive” for fear of losing it. (Tr. 60-61)
Applicant acknowledged viewing pornography on his personal computer beginning
after he and his second wife separated in 2011. He said he did so only at home. (Tr. 95,
107)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  use  his  personal  EHD  for  that  purpose.  (Tr.  91-92).
However,  in  AE  A,  his  affidavit,  Applicant  stated  that,  “on  my  personal  EHD,  I  stored
images that could be described as pornographic” but not illegal. (AE A at ¶ 55)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  it  was  “possible”  that  he  had  transferred  or
downloaded  pornographic  files  from  his  personal  computer  to  his  personal  EHD.  He
testified, “I don’t specifically recall purposely doing it, but I ran backups. It was possible that
the scope of the backup included some of those files. . . . I can’t say for certain that I did
not.”  (Tr.  61-62)  “Yes,  it’s possible.  I  certainly  didn’t  do  it  intentionally.” (Tr. 96-97)  He
maintained a “robust firewall” for virus and malware protection on his personal computer
and believed it to be better than what the company used. (Tr. 62) Applicant acknowledged
that he could have accessed his personal files from the company tablet. (Tr. 65)
Applicant denied storing pornography on company assets: “All I can say is I did not
put  it  there.”  (Tr.  95-96)  He  denied  downloading  and  saving  pornographic  content  on
company  assets  during  working  hours.  (Tr.  65)  Applicant  “absolutely”  denied  using  a
company  1  computer,  tablet,  or  EHD  to  view  pornography.  (Tr.  92)  “I  did  not  put
pornography  on  [company  1’s]  owned  tablet,”  or  on  any  piece  of  company  computing
equipment.  (Tr.  38,  47-48,  66)  Applicant  “never  stored  or  accessed  any  inappropriate
personal images, videos, or documents” on the company 1 tablet, the company EHD, or
through any company technology. (AE A at ¶ 59; Tr. 54-55)
Applicant did not recall e-mailing a 50-page movie list file from his work e-mail to his
personal e-mail (as noted in GE 4) and said, “I don’t know why I’d do it. . . . It just doesn’t
make sense to me.” (Tr. 98-99) He testified that he would have no reason to put files such
as “recent downloads list 4/8/17” or “movielist.txt” on the company 1 tablet. (Tr. 67)  He
acknowledged,  however  that  it  was  “possible”  that  he  had  a  movie  list  file  or a  recent
download file concerning pornographic video or imagery on his personal computer, and
that he “may have” maintained such a list on his personal computer, but did not recall
specifically. “Because certainly in 2017 I was living with my current wife. So there may well
have been files created at an earlier date. Say before June of 2016.” (Tr. 67-68) He said he
did not remember creating such a document, and did not know why it would be on his work
computer. (Tr. 99, 100) He acknowledged, however, that “I might have created a – a file
that had an earlier date, or no date at all, but . . . only on my personal computer.” (Tr. 100)
Applicant did not recall having a membership to a specific adult website, or visiting
that specific website on his personal computer; that website was listed in GE 4 as having
been discovered on his work computer. He said it was possible that the company’s firewall
let some inappropriate e-mails through and he clicked on them by mistake, but deleted
them quickly. He recalled asking company IT to “beef up” their e-mail firewall to stop such
e-mails and access to such sites. (Tr. 69-70, 99)
Applicant no longer uses a company EHD to transfer professional files between
home and work. He has a work laptop with a docking station at home that he uses instead.
He does not keep work or proprietary files on his personal computer. (Tr. 109-110)
Applicant has not been in counseling or therapy with respect to pornography. (Tr.
101) He continues to view pornography at home, including occasionally with his wife. (Tr.
91, 100)
Applicant believes that other employees of company 1 had professional access to
administrative passwords, as he did, and “easily could access any [company 1] laptop or
tablet and insert files onto that computing equipment.” (AE A at ¶¶ 69-71; Tr. 45-47) He
believes that company 1 “either invented any ‘evidence’ it claimed that it had, or, while I
was  away  from  my  desk,  someone  connected  that  personal  [EHD]  to  the  tablet  and
uploaded pornographic images from that personally owned external drive to the tablet.” (AE
A at ¶ 72) He believes that the real reason he was terminated was “because I had called
out several instances of unethical behavior and business practices in the company.” (AE A
at ¶ 77)
On  his  September  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  been  fired  from
company 1 for “alleged misuse of computer” and “I was told that pornographic files had
been found on computer equipment in my possession.” He also noted that this was shortly
after he had filed formal complaints about another employee for sexual harassment of
female employees “and lying to me about statements made by my staff.” (GE 1 at 16, 17)
Applicant  answered  “No”  to  the  following  question  on  his  SCA  concerning
unauthorized or unlawful use of information technology systems:
In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  introduced,  removed,  or  used
hardware, software, or media in connection with any information technology
system  without  authorization,  when  specifically  prohibited  by  rules,
procedures, guidelines, or regulations or attempted any of the above? (GE 1
at 57)
Applicant’s July 2019 background interview summary reflects that he was confronted
with  apparent  evidence,  through  an  interview  with  a  coworker,  of  the  fact  that  an
investigation  of  Applicant’s  laptop  found  pornography  linked  to  Applicant’s  username,
password, and times and dates when he was logged in to the computer. (GE 2 at 2) The
coworker is not identified and no specifics are provided, let alone documented, in GE 2. In
the interview, Applicant denied any knowledge of the images. (GE 2 at 2) The remainder of
Applicant’s  background  interview  largely  concerns  the  sexual  harassment  allegations
against Mr. C and Applicant’s efforts to bring them to light; the May 2017 meeting with
company officials that led to Applicant’s termination; Applicant’s assumption that Mr. C had
something  to  do  with  transferring  pornographic  files  onto  Applicant’s  computer,  and
Applicant’s discussion of his affair with S. (GE 2 at 2)
Work and Character References
J testified both as a character witness and a fact witness for Applicant. He has been
a  lawyer  for  almost  40  years,  with  about  17-18  years  as  general  counsel  for  various
defense contractors. He was general counsel for company 1 from 2004 to February 2010,
when Applicant was there, and has known him since then. (Tr. 124-126, 137) J is now in
private practice. (He was also Applicant’s original counsel in this case, and filed Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, though he did not testify in that capacity). (Tr. 142-143)
As  an  in-house  general  counsel,  J  handled  many  company  investigations  of
pornography on company computers. As such, J in his testimony took issue with company
1’s  handing  of  the  investigation  in  this  case.  He  testified  that  such  investigations  are
typically discovered and investigated by HR and not by the legal department, though the
legal department would review the findings. (Tr. 127-128, 133-134) He also believes that
company 1’s legal department should have considered recusing itself from the investigation
because the subject of the investigation was a senior company officer, as were others
potentially involved. (Tr. 135) J also questioned the findings of the report, that there was
evidence of pornography on work computers and any download of such materials during
work hours, to support the conclusions in GE 4 that such conduct was established. (Tr.
135-136)
J acknowledged, however, that if it were confirmed that pornography was found on
an  employee’s  work  computer,  it  was  best  practice,  even  “essential,”  to  escort  that
employee from the building immediately and place the employee on either paid or unpaid
leave. (Tr. 128) He also said where there was reasonable basis to believe such employee
misconduct had taken place, “it’s not a high bar.” (Tr. 128)
J described Applicant as a brilliant intellectual, with both an engineering background
and a “common sense” notion of how a business runs. (Tr. 138-139) He said Applicant has
impeccable moral character, and an excellent sense of ethics, including as company 1’s
chief ethics officer. He is highly trustworthy and warrants being granted clearance eligibility.
(Tr. 140-141, 145-146) Prior to his legal representation of Applicant, J was not aware of
Applicant’s  sexual  relationship  with  a  subordinate  employee.  J  has  never  put  false
information into an investigative report, nor would he ever do so. (Tr. 143-144)
Mr. M is a retired U.S. Navy captain and naval aviator, and a former employee of
company 1. He was a company vice president who reported directly to Applicant. They had
daily interaction, and often travelled together for work. They worked together for several
months, about five years ago. They had met previously when Mr. M ran another company.
(Tr. 115-119)
Mr. M was with Applicant the day Applicant was escorted out of the building. Mr. M
heard days later that this happened because pornography had been found on a company
laptop, “which struck me as really weird for a guy like [Applicant] who is smart as heck to
do something so stupid, but he was gone, so I just let it go at that.” (Tr. 120) Mr. M left
company 1 about two months after Applicant was terminated. (Tr. 120)
Mr. M regards Applicant as someone of the highest intellect, one of the “top five”
people  in  terms  of  intellect  that  he  has  met  in  40  years  of  professional  and  military
experience. He testified to Applicant’s intelligence and “flawless” character, and attested
that  his  judgment  and  trustworthiness  were  “beyond  reproach.”  He  was  not  aware  of
Applicant’s relationship with S at the time it was occurring (Mr. M also was not working
there  at  the  time). (Tr. 117-119) Mr. M  regards  Applicant  as a great American and an
intellectual asset to the country. The fact that he may have had “something stupid on his
computer is completely out of character.” (Tr. 121-122)
Mr. M also testified that he was aware of a sexual harassment claim made against
Mr. C by a woman who worked for Mr. M. Mr. M directed that she should report the matter
to HR. He also reported it to Applicant. (Tr. 116)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.a and 4.a. She
denied the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.b. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old. She graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in
December 2019. She then pursued and completed a professional certificate in 2021 and
was accepted into a master’s program, which began in August 2022. She married in 2022
and  has  no  children.  She  began  college  in 2015.  In about  May 2017,  she moved  to a
different state and transferred to a local college in her new state. She also worked part-
time as an intern for her present employer, a federal contractor, until she graduated from
college in December 2019. After graduation, she was offered a full-time position by her
present employer and has worked for them since January 2020. (Tr. 23-29; GE 1; AE F,
J, L, M, N)
From approximately September 2015 to May 2017, Applicant used marijuana with
varying frequency. She was 18 to 20 years old at the time. She smoked marijuana with
friends. She stopped using marijuana when she moved to the new state and distanced
herself from the friends with whom she was using it. She credibly testified that she has
not used marijuana or any other illegal drug since May 2017 and does not intend to do so
in the future. When she got married, her wedding was in the state where she previously
lived, and none of her former friends were invited to her wedding. Her husband does not
use  illegal  drugs.  She  provided  a  hair  follicle  drug  analysis  from  June  29,  2022,  with
negative results for illegal drugs. (Tr. 42-47; AE O)
In August 2016, Applicant was in a car with friends when it was stopped by the
police. Marijuana was found in the car. Applicant testified it did not belong to her. She and
the other occupants were arrested. She was charged with possession of marijuana with
the intent to use. She stated she was confused about the arrest and that is why she denied
SOR ¶ 1.b. She said when she went to court a couple of days after the incident, she was
told the charges were dismissed. She did not go before a judge or meet with anyone from
the prosecutor’s office. Her FBI record shows the charge was dismissed. She requested
this charge be expunged from her record and it was so ordered by the court in October
2021. (Tr. 47-48, 70-72; GE 3, AE P)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR  she  explained  that in February  2017,  she  was
attending   college   at  X   University   (XU)  in  her  home   state.  In   her  first  semester  of   her
sophomore year, she  received  a  D in  a  course. She  felt  she  deserved  a  better grade. She
had   to   retake   the   class  in  the   spring   semester  and   felt   the   situation   was  unfair,  which
caused  her not to  take  the  course  seriously. On  her first test,  she  received  a  failing  grade.
She  tried  to  make  up  for it, but  received  a  failing  grade  on  her second  exam. She  knew
even  if  she  scored  100% on  her final exam,  she  would still  fail  the  course.  At the  time,
she  was working  part  time  in  the  Office  of  Information  Technology  (OIT) at XU. She  stated
that  before considering  the  ramifications  and  consequences  of her actions,  she  thought
she   could   use   her access  in   the   OIT  to   change   her   grade,   which  she  did.   In   her   SOR
answer, she  said she  then  felt guilty  and  an  hour later she  emailed  her professor telling
her that Applicant’s grade  was incorrectly  put in the  system. Her  professor thanked  her
and corrected  the  grade. She  did not tell  the  professor that it was her who  changed  the
grade. Two  days later,  she  was summoned  to  the  OIT  by  managers who  confronted  her
with  what she  had  done. They  reported  her conduct to  XU and  the  police. She  said  in her
SOR  answer  that  she   was  unaware  that  her  conduct   could   lead   to   serious  criminal
allegations.  She  attributed  her  actions to  being  immature  and  she  had  no  excuse. (Tr. 48-
49, 73-79; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  about  the  specifics  of  her  actions.  She  gained  access  to  the
professor’s  portal and  changed the password  on  the professor’s  account so she could
change the grade. The professor was notified that her password changed and notified the
OIT  asking  why  it  had  changed.  When  the  OIT  became  aware,  they  investigated  the
action,  which  was  traced  back  to  Applicant’s  computer and  the  time  she  was  working.
Applicant testified she was aware of the rules and protocol of working in the OIT and her
conduct  was  a  violation.  When  Applicant  was  confronted  by  the  manager  of  the  OIT
regarding changing the password, she initially denied it and did not take responsibility for
her conduct. She also denied it to the XU conduct board. At her hearing, she testified that
XU  conducted  an  investigation  and  she  was  suspended from  school  at  the  end  of  the
semester for six months. She received an F in the course. She was permitted to complete
her other courses before the suspension. She said she was humiliated and embarrassed.
(Tr. 48-49, 73-79)
In March 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with accessing, falsifying or
tampering with data or computer records, a felony, for her actions at XU. She did not tell
her parents until months later. A public defender represented her. The prosecutor agreed
to  accept  a  Pretrial  Intervention  (PTI)  program,  which  lasted  30  months.  She  was  on
probation  and  had  to  contact  her  probation  officer,  participate  in  drug  testing,  and  not
commit any offenses. She was able to move to a new state while still on probation, but
had to continue to contact her probation officer and was required to notify the probation
officer if she got into any trouble. (Tr. 50-53, 79-84)
In June 2018, while still participating in the PTI and working as an intern with her
employer, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting. She admits her conduct was selfish and
lacked good judgment. She walked into a department store, grabbed four purses, put a
small one in her purse, put another over her shoulder, tried to hide one and said the other
she did not try to hide. A security guard stopped her, checked the tags on the purses and
the police were called. She was arrested and taken to jail. She called her boyfriend, who
later would be her husband. He was upset. She called a bail bondsman, paid the bond,
and was released. She testified that she immediately contacted her probation officer and
told the officer of her arrest. When she returned to court for the charge, the official from
the store failed to appear and the charge was dismissed. She testified that she thought
she got away with it and did it again as noted below. (Tr. 52, 84-89)
In October 2018, Applicant was arrested again for shoplifting. She went into a large
retail store, put items in her cart and went through the self-checkout aisle. She purchased
the items and grabbed extra plastic shopping bags. After completing her purchase and
before leaving the store, she went back through the store and filled the bags with items.
She  then  left  the  store  with  items  she  stole  and  drove  away.  She  was  subsequently
stopped by the police and was arrested. She testified she did this one other time at the
same store about a month earlier and got away with it. She also did it once when she was
in high school, got caught, but she was not arrested and was released by the store.1 (Tr.
55, 89-92)
Applicant testified that she reported the second shoplifting incident to her probation
officer.  She  admitted  that  after  her first  shoplifting arrest,  she felt  she  got  away  with  it
without  consequences  after  the  charge  was  dropped.  In  her  answer  to  the  SOR,  she
stated that when she went to court for the October 2018 offense, she asked the judge if
there  was  a  diversion  program  she  could  participate  in  that  would  help  her  with  her
“kleptomania-like  tendencies”:  She  entered  a  Pretrial  Diversion  (PTD)  program  that
included classes focused on shoplifting.  She said it changed her life and forced her to
think about why she was doing destructive things and how her actions impacted other’s
lives and property. She completed the program in December 2018 and the charge was
dismissed. (Tr. 55-57, 92-93; AE R)
Applicant testified that as part of the PTD program it was recommended that she
seek  therapy,  which  she  did  through  her  college  counseling  services.  She  said  she
attended therapy about once a month for about a year. Discussions were about why she
was struggling, adjusting to a new area, family expectations, and feelings of entitlement.
(Tr. 107-114)
Applicant  completed  the  PTI  program  in  November 2019  and  the  felony charge
was dismissed. In October 2021, this charge was expunged under the same order as her
2016 drug arrest. (Tr. 54-55; AE P, Q)
Applicant did not report her criminal conduct of misusing information technology or
that she was participating in a PTI program to her employer while she was an intern. This
offense occurred before she was hired as an intern. She did not report to her employer
her shoplifting arrests in June 2018 and October 2018 or that she was participating in a
1 I will not consider  any  derogatory  information for disqualifying purposes  that  was  not alleged in the SOR,
but may  consider  it  when applying  the  mitigating  conditions, in  making  a  credibility  determination  and  in my
whole-person  analysis.
PTD program. She did not believe she was obligated to report her criminal arrests as an
intern and because she was not a full-time employee. She testified that her boyfriend at
the time, now her husband, did review the rules to see if he was obligated to report the
information  and  he  was  not.  He  did  not  counsel  her  to  report  the  information  to  their
employer.  She  testified  that  she  considered  reporting  it,  but  did  not  want  to  risk  an
opportunity to be hired full time. She testified that she has not been involved in any other
authorized computer access since her incident at XU. (Tr. 57-59, 94-98, 106-107)
Applicant provided a document to show that the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS)  gave  her  a  fitness/suitability  determination  where  she  has  access  to  a  level  of
sensitive information. She testified she had to complete an Electronic Questionnaires for
Investigation Processing in 2021. She said she disclosed her criminal arrests. (Tr. 31-32,
5998-100; AE E)
Applicant provided numerous documents reflecting her exceptional performance
while  working  for  her  employer.  She  received  17  awards  since  October  2019  and  her
year-end  reviews  from  2020  and  2021  also  reflect  her  outstanding  performance  and
contribution to the company and its mission. (Tr. 30-35; AE F, G, H, I)
Applicant provided a letter of recommendation from Dr. W from July 2021, that was
submitted  for  Applicant’s  application  for  enrollment  into  the  professional  certificate
program, which she completed. She also provided a letter of recommendation from him
for  a  security  clearance.  The  letter  glowingly  describes  Applicant’s  academic  abilities,
motivation, and personal qualities. She is described as a self-starter, a team player, and
a  problem-solver.  She  is  considered  tenacious,  hardworking,  and  dedicated.  Dr.  W
described Applicant as having a solid work ethic, moral character, and is pleasant and
confident.  He  considers  her  honest  and  has  never  questioned  her  loyalty.  She  is  the
epitome of professionalism, intelligence, integrity and dedication. He recommended her
for a security clearance. Applicant testified that Dr. W was not made aware of the SOR
allegations or her criminal charges. (Tr. 38-40; AE B, K)
Applicant provided a July 2021 character letter from her direct supervisor at work
who has known her for four years. He indicated  in his letter that he  was aware of  “her
need for a security clearance.” He has had regular interaction with her since 2018 and
frequently on a daily basis. He described her as being a diligent worker with a strong work
ethic  and  uncompromised  integrity.  She  sets  the  example  for  her  peers  in  terms  of
dedication, trustworthiness, reliability, and stability. She received 10 performance awards
from  2020  to  2021,  which  is  unmatched  by  her  peers.  Applicant  testified  that  her
supervisor was not privy to the allegations in the SOR or her background, and he is only
aware of her work history. (Tr. 35-38; AE A)
Applicant  provided  a  recommendation  for  promotion  from  Dr.  D.  It  states  that
Applicant executes high quality technical work, engages in leadership behavior, supports
and  monitors  the  team.  She  motivates  others.  Dr.  D  also  described  different  technical
accomplishments of Applicant and recommended her for promotion. (Tr. 40-42; AE C)
Applicant’s husband provided a statement on behalf of her. He has known his wife
since  2017.  He  works  for  the  same  company.  He  describes  her  as  one  of  the  most
honorable  and  hardworking  individuals  he  has  ever  known.  He  was  aware  of  some
mistakes she made and that she exercised poor judgment when she was younger. He is
aware of mistakes she made in 2018. He stated she can be trusted. If he did not believe
that she could be trusted, he would not be married to her. He would not jeopardize the
security clearance he holds. She volunteers for difficult tasks and rises to the occasion.
She is a valuable asset to the company. (Tr. 63-67; AE D)
Applicant provided a copy of her credit report that reflects she pays her bills and
has no financial issues. She purchased a vehicle in 2019 and paid the loan in 2020. She
was responsible for paying her tuition and her father helped her with half of it. She worked
and went to school at the same time and was responsible for her monthly expenses. (Tr.
60-62; AE S, T)
Applicant stated  in  her  Answer to  the  SOR  and  testimony  that  she  has received
accolades for her outstanding  performance  and  awards that  were provided  as exhibits.
She  works on  important projects that impact the  public interest. She  volunteers her time
for students  in the  science, technology, engineering  and  mathematics (STEM) curriculum
for grades kindergarten  through  12th  grade  as a  mentor and  judge  in  competitions. She
also  mentored   an   all-girls  robotics  team.  She   volunteers  at  work  and   participates  in
different teams that help others. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant provided a lengthy and detailed Answer to the SOR. In it, she repeatedly
takes full responsibility for her conduct and makes no excuses. When testifying she did
the  same  and  was  candid.  She  attributed  her  drug  involvement  with  being  around  the
wrong people and has put that in her past. She says she has turned her life around. The
PTD class forced her to reflect on her life and she saw people like her who were also
struggling with their choices. She found it beneficial and it was an epiphany in her life.
She attributes her criminal conduct to being young, immature, and selfish. She says she
is no longer that person, and she has learned her lessons and grown from her mistakes.
She is thankful that the system gave her a second chance to restart her life.

"Applicant  is  44  years  old.  He  is  married  with  five  children.  He  has  a  Master’s
degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Design
and  Analysis  Engineer  IV.  He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  connection
with his employment.
Guideline D –  Sexual Behavior
Guideline M –  Use of Information Technology
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  for  many  years,  between  2003  and  2014,
engaged in sexual misconduct in the workplace, the misuse of information technology,
and poor personal conduct.  Applicant admits in part and denies in part the allegations
set forth in the SOR.  (See Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.)
Applicant’s first job out of college was working for a defense contractor from 2003
to 2011.  He was  granted a security clearance  in 2003  or 2004.  During this period of
In  2009,  he  underwent  a

polygraph  examination  and  admitted  that  he  viewed  pornography  on  his  corporate
computer  about  a  dozen  times,  and  he  masturbated  in  his  office  on  three  to  five
occasions.  (Tr.  p.  49.)
In  September  2009,  he  was  required  to  sign  a  Government
policy  statement  confirming  this  misconduct.  From  2011  to  2013,  he  left  his
employment in the defense industry and worked outside of the industry.  (Government
Exhibit 3.)
In  2013,  Applicant  re-entered  the  defense  industry,  and  started  working  for  his
current employer.  He was granted a special access clearance in late 2014.  In 2014, he
again  underwent  a  polygraph  examination.  During  this  polygraph  examination,
Applicant admitted that he had relapsed in viewing pornography at work, which occurred
about ten times.  (Tr. p. 51.)  This  time, however,  he  was  viewing pornography  on  his
cell phone  while  at  work.  This misconduct occurred  about every three months  or so.
He also admitted to misusing his corporate computer in many ways.  He loading a non-
work related compact disc into it between 2003 and 2007; he had used a personal USB
drive to transfer proprietary text files and powerpoint presentations from 2008 to 2011;
he  had  used  a  personal  USB  drive  to  transfer  proprietary  information  between
November 2013 to March 2014; and, he had used his corporate computer to charge his
cell phone one to two times per week from October 2013 to May 2014.  Applicant stated
that  he  deliberately  withheld  information  about  his  use  of  personal  USB  drives  in  his
corporate computer during his earlier investigation in 2008.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
1.a.     Applicant,   on   multiple   occasions   between   2005   until  at  least  2014,   used   the
corporate   computer  to   view   pornography   at  work.     This  conduct   was  in  violation   of
company   and   DoD  policies  and   regulations,  as  well   as  United   States  Intelligence
Community   policy.     Applicant   testified   that   in  2005,   he   was  working   full   time   for  a
defense  contractor,  and  working  on  his Master’s degree.  He was twenty-five  years old,
newly   married,   with   a   young   family.    He  was  balancing   lots   of  demands,   and   was
stressed.    He  found   that  the   only   privacy  he   had   was  at  the   office,   and   he   started   to
view  pornography  at work on  the  corporate  computer.   This misconduct continued  until
at least 2014.   He  explained  that  he  would usually  work more than  the  standard  40-hour
work week, and  after hours or on  a  break he  would view  pornography.  He  stated  that
he never did  it  where anyone  could  see  him.   He  stated  that he  has  not engaged  in this
misconduct since  2014.   He  knew  this misconduct to  be  prohibited, but chose  to  engage
in it anyway.
1.b.   Applicant,  on  multiple occasions  from  2005  until at least  2008, masturbated  in his
office  while   at  work.    He   believes  this  occurred   between   two   to   four  or  five   separate
occasions.     He   testified   that  he   realized   that  this  behavior  was   not  in  line   with   his
religious beliefs and  wanting  to  be  honest with  his wife  and  his church leaders,  and  so
he  started  seeing  a  counselor for this behavior.   He  stated  that he  has not engaged  in
this misconduct  since  2008.   Applicant knew  this misconduct  to  be  prohibited,  but chose
to engage in it anyway.
2.a.  See  Applicant’s misconduct  discussion  above under  1.a.
2.b.   Applicant,  on  multiple  occasions from  2008  to  at  least  2014,  transferred   personal
files  without  authorization   between   his  corporate   computer  and   his  personal  home
computer using  his personal thumb  drives.    He stated  that he   has  not engaged  in this
misconduct   since   2014.       He   knew   this  misconduct  to   be   prohibited,   but  chose   to
engage in it anyway.
2.c.     Applicant,   on   multiple   occasions  from   about  2003   to   2007,  loaded   unauthorized
software  onto   his   corporate   computer.    He  testified   that   he   would  load   a music CD   on
his corporate  computer.  He also used  the  charger on  his corporate  computer to  charge
his  personal   cell   phone.    He  stated   that  he   has  not   engaged   in   this  misconduct   since
2007.  He  knew this misconduct to be prohibited, but chose to engage in it anyway.
3.a.    In   February   2015,  the   Government   revoked   Applicant’s   existing   access  to
classified  Information  and  disapproved  any  additional access  for violation  of Intelligence
Community   Policy   guidance   704.2.     In   September  2009,  Applicant  signed   a   US
Government  policy   statement  wherein   it  noted   that  his  viewing   of  pornography   on   his
corporate  computer,  and  his masturbating  in the  office, which occurred  between  2005  to
2008   were  noted   misconduct  under   personal   conduct   and   misuse   of  information
technology   systems.    He   understood   at  that  time   that  his  misconduct  was  against
company  and  Government policies.   In  2014, during  polygraph testing  of  the  Applicant,
he  stated   that  he   did   not  take   the   signed   policy   statement  seriously.    He  believed   his
misconduct was okay  because  he  was not  using  his corporate  computer.  At that time,
he stated  that he  attended  Sexaholics Anonymous due  to  his addiction  to  pornography.
He   estimated   that  he   has  occasion   to   relapse   into   the   sexual  addiction   approximately
every   three   months  where  he   views  pornography   on   his  cell   phone   while   at  work.
(Government Exhibit 3.)
3.b.  See  Applicant’s misconduct discussed  above in  paragraph 1.
3.c.   See  Applicant’s misconduct discussed  above in  paragraph 2.
Two  polygraph  examinations  of  the  Applicant,  the first  conducted by a  previous
employer in 2008, and the second conducted in 2014, by his current employer, revealed
that for many years, while employed in the defense industry, Applicant has engaged in
sexual misconduct in the workplace.  He has also misused information technology, and
engaged in poor personal conduct.  These actions were in violation of DoD policies and
procedures.
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  received  regular  security  briefings  from  his
employers  since  beginning  his  employment  in  the  defense  industry.  (Tr.  p.  76.)  He
stated that when he started working for the defense industry he was young and ignorant
and  just  learning  the  rules  and  regulations.  He  believes  that  he  now  has  a  firm
understanding of  the company policy and procedures.  He believes he has  grown and
matured since  he committed these violations, as it has been nearly ten  years.  This is
not entirely accurate.  Applicant engaged in misconduct as a young man in his twenties,
and  this  misconduct  continued,  with  pattern  of  relapse,  well  into  his  late  thirties.  He
underwent his first polygraph examination in 2008, and was made aware of misconduct,
when he signed a U.S. Government policy statement in September 2009.  His relapses
were noted in 2014, and his Special Access was revoked in February 2015.
Applicant testified that although he would like to work in the defense industry for
a contractor, he does not need a security clearance in order to be employable.  He has
chosen to confront these issues in his past and would like to work for the Government,
but there are many companies outside of the Department of Defense that could use his
skills  without  the  need  for  a  security  clearance.
In  fact,  that  is  what  he  was  doing
between 2011 and 2013, working in other fields outside of the Government.
Excerpts from  Applicant’s employment records reflect that he  has been  a  major
contributor to the company.  Documents reflecting his  job performance show that he has
either “met expectations”, “exceeded”,  or “far exceeded”   his job  requirements.   He has
also  been   eligible   for  the   retention   bonus   program.    (Applicant’s   Exhibit  B.)   Applicant
testified   that  since   2013,  his  performance   evaluations  have   been   excellent.     He   has
received  ratings of either “exceeds expectations” or “greatly  exceeds expectations.”  (Tr.
p. 20.)   He stated that he gets along well  with his co-workers and  management.
Letters of recommendation from various individuals who know the Applicant well,
who  include  friends,  church  members,  his  wife,  and  his  counselor,  attest  to  his
character,  patriotism  and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  They  collectively
indicate   that  Applicant   is  trustworthy,  responsible   and   has  good   judgment.     They   all
recommend that he be granted  a security clearance.    (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
A  letter  from  his  counselor  confirmed  that  Applicant  attended  sessions  twice  a
month  at  first  and  then  later  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  sessions  involved  therapy  in
dealing with stress management techniques and how to avoid his addiction.  In addition
how  to  be  accountable  to  his  wife,  church  community  and  others.  He  believes  that

"Applicant  is 31 years old  and married  since 2018.  He has  two  stepchildren and
one child with his wife. He graduated from high school in June 2010. Immediately after
graduating, Applicant enlisted in the Army for six years. He was stationed in a European
country  for  a  three-year  tour.  While  there  he  deployed  to  the  Middle  East  for  eleven
months  on  a  combat  mission.  (Tr.  21-22  He  served  in  the  military  until  October  2016,
when he was honorably discharged, as a logistical specialist (E-4). (Tr. 23) While serving,
he received individual awards. (Tr. 23)  He received his first security clearance in 2011
and has held it since then. (Tr. 59) He subsequently used his military benefits to earn a
bachelor’s degree in 2017 and a master’s degree in 2021, both in the field of information
technology. (Tr. 15-17, 23; GE 1 at 29.)
After  his  discharge  from  the  Army,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  technical  IT
support representative for civilian company (FB) in August 2016. He worked there until
April 2017 when he was fired for accessing his supervisor’s email without authorization.
(Tr.  19,  67;  GE  1  at  24)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  wrongly  accessed  said  email  and
acknowledged that it was a mistake and childish behavior on his part. (Tr. 25, 31)
Applicant explained that FB was his first job after leaving active duty and he soon
became  frustrated  with  the  company  and  the  manner  in  which  his  supervisor  treated
employees.  During  his  last  work  week  at  FB,  (he  had  secured  another  position),  he
decided to access his supervisor’s emails and  review them  for  disparaging information
about  his  co-workers.  (Tr.  25,  28-29,  60)  After  locating  some  emails  with  pejorative
statements, Applicant copied two excerpts and sent them in emails to his supervisor and
the chief executive officer (CEO) on his last work day. In his email Applicant commented
on  their  inappropriate  conduct  involving  employees.  (Tr.  32,  45-46)  Applicant  said  this
was the only time he accessed his supervisor’s email (Tr. 27, 32) He has never accessed
anyone else’s email since this incident. (Tr. 34, 39, 47)
In  retrospect,  Applicant  admitted
impulsive  and
unprofessional.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was  upset  with  the  FB’s  treatment  of
employees. He agreed that he should have handled his concerns differently, such as by
talking to his supervisor instead of accessing his email. (Tr. 62, 67)
that  his  behavior  was
After leaving  FB in April 2017, Applicant started  working  for civilian  IT  company
HC.  In   June   2017,  he   was  fired   for  accessing   a   company’s  application   without  having
proper  credentials  while   he   was   on   a   90-day   probation.  Applicant   explained   that  his
supervisor assigned  him  a  task  for which he  needed  access  to a specific system  in order
to   perform   the   work.   Thinking   that  she   wanted   the   work  completed,  he   asked   his  co-
worker for the  organization’s login credentials.  He did not ask for the  co-worker’s  personal
information.  He  said  his co-worker provided  the  company’s login and  he  then  completed
the  task and  logged  out. The  following  day, another supervisor discovered  his actions  and
fired him.  (Tr. 50)
Applicant said he did not make any mistakes in completing the task, but was fired
because he was in the probationary period and did not yet have access to that system.
(Tr. 56) He does not think that his co-worker who provided the information was disciplined
for giving him the information. (Tr. 52) He acknowledged that he should have clarified his
supervisor’s request before asking his co-worker for the company’s login credentials. (Tr.
51)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  started  working  for  civilian  company  A,  as  a  software
analyst. He left that position in October 2018 for a better paying position with government
contractor D. He worked for D for two months as a systems administrator, at which time
the contract ended. He then started a position with the Army in January 2019 and stayed
there until July 2019, when that contract ended. (GE 1 at 18-25) In August 2019, he began
his current position with defense contractor (K), as a senior system administrator and site
lead. This position requires a security clearance. (Tr. 14)
On  April  27,  2021,  the  CEO  for  FB  signed  an  affidavit  regarding  Applicant’s
termination  with  FB  in  August  2016.  In  it,  the  CEO  stated  Applicant  disseminated
information
to  employees  about  management  activities,  meetings,  salary,  and
performance information. (AE 3) Applicant denied that allegation and said he never saw
that information and did not have access to it. (Tr. 43-44)
Applicant testified  that he  has not had  any  employment issues since  leaving  HC,
in June  2017. He has never accessed  another person’s email, used  a  logon  password
that was not his, or been  disciplined  for wrongdoing. He said he  has received  excellent
reviews  at K. (Tr. 56-58). He told all  of  the  people who  submitted  character references
about his past  conduct,  as  well  as his  wife.  (Tr.  63-64) He  admitted  that he  held  a  position
of trust  at FB  and violated it by accessing his supervisor’s email. (Tr. 66)
Applicant  submitted  nine  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job  performance  and
strong moral character.  One  of  the  letters is from a  soldier with  whom he  served. The
other eight letters are from colleagues with whom he has worked since early 2019. He is
praised  for  his  trustworthiness,  work  ethic,  and  judgment.  (AE  D  through  AE  L)  The
contracting officer for the project Applicant works on wrote that she has known him since
January  2019.  She  stated  he  is  a  critical  part  of  her  team  and  he  supervises  11
employees.”  (AE  D)  She  said  he  is  “exceptionally  trustworthy.”  (Id.)  A  senior  systems

Financial Considerations
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges   Applicant filed  for discharge   of   liabilities   totaling   $149,105   in
January   2014   under  Chapter  7   of   the   Bankruptcy   Code,  and   the   bankruptcy   judge
discharged  his nonpriority  unsecured  debts in  April 2015. (GE  1  at 35; GE  2  at 9; GE  6  at
1)  The  secured  claims  totaled  $110,935;  the  priority  claims were $850; and  the  unsecured
nonpriority  claims were $37,320. (GE  2  at  9) Around  2012,  Applicant  and  his second  wife
separated, and he was unable to pay the bills without her income. (Tr. 44)  In 2013, his
starting pay was about $24 an hour. (Tr. 42) When he filed for bankruptcy, Applicant was
$24,000 behind on his $107,604 mortgage, and the fair market value of the property was
substantially below the amount of the mortgage. (Tr. 112; GE 2 at 16) The bankruptcy
documentation  indicates  Applicant’s  monthly  income  over  the  previous  six  months
averaged $5,647, and his IRS tax transcript showed his income for Tax Year (TY) 2014
was about $109,000. (Tr. 113) Applicant suggested that perhaps the extra funds on his
TY 2014 tax return came from his military duties, overtime with his contractor employer,
or a cash payout from a previous employer. (Compare Tr. 116 with GE 2 at 49-51) He
understood that his income could not exceed the threshold in the bankruptcy statute, or
he would not qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. (Tr. 114-115) He
said he would provide documentation after his hearing to show his income statement on
his bankruptcy was correct. (Tr. 117, 121) He did not provide the evidence showing the
income  on  his  bankruptcy  submission  was  accurate.  His  bankruptcy  documentation
included a $2,576 state tax lien. (Tr. 48)
SOR ¶  1.b  alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes totaling  $6,112 for TY
2014.  (GE 3  at 2, 9)  His September 24, 2020  IRS  tax  transcript for  TY  2014  shows an
account balance  of  $9,177  owed  to  the  IRS, and  it shows IRS  tax  transfers to  address his
TY  2014  tax  debt from  TY  2017  of  $1,143, from  TY  2018  of  $1,037, and  from  TY  2019  of
$647. (GE 4  at 9-10) He also made  a  $143  payment on  March 10,  2020. (Id.) On  February
14,  2020,  Applicant told  an  Office  of Personnel Management  (OPM)  investigator that  he
“arranged  a  payment plan  with  the  IRS,  and  made  on-time  payments until [he] defaulted.”
(GE  10   at  2)  He  did   not  resume   payments.   (Id.)  He  told   the   OPM   investigator  that  he
intended  to  borrow  funds from  his 401k account to  pay  his delinquent tax  debt. (GE  10  at

of  $6,112. (AE  B) Applicant’s October 1, 2021  IRS  tax  transcript for TY  2020  shows on
April 15,  2021, he  had  a  $1,332  credit transferred  to  address  his  TY  2014  tax  debt, and
he  received  a  $360  refund. (GE  3  at 18)  The  $360  refund  shows all of  his federal income
taxes are paid through  TY 2020.

2010, 2012, and 2013. (GE 3 at 2, 4) His September 24, 2020 TY 2015 IRS tax transcript
indicates in 2018 the IRS assessed an additional tax of $1,900;  he had a $274 penalty
for filing his tax return late; and no payments were shown to address his tax debt. (GE 4
at 5-6) His account balance owed on September 24, 2020, was $5,593. (GE 4 at 5) He
said he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2) The IRS $360 refund of his TY 2020 taxes shows
the IRS concluded all of his previous federal income taxes were paid. (GE 3 at 18)
The information in the following table is based on Applicant’s September 24, 2020
and October 1, 2021 IRS tax transcripts. (GE 4; AE A-AE D) Adjusted gross income is
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. He did not provide tax transcripts for TYs 2010,
2012, and 2013.

Applicant’s October 1, 2021 TY 2011 IRS tax transcript shows he had an IRS tax
payment agreement from November 2016 to February 2018. (GE 3 at 8) He made nine
payments from $80 to $155. (Id.) In October 2018, his debt to the IRS for TY 2011 was
paid. (Id.)
Applicant’s  September  25,  2020  TY  2016  IRS  tax  transcript  indicates  the  IRS
assessed an additional penalty of $125 for filing his tax return late; and his September
24, 2020 IRS tax transcript for TY 2016 shows an account balance owed of $327. (GE 4
at 7-8) He said he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2)
On February 14, 2020, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he timely filed his
2015 and 2016 state tax returns. (GE 10 at 2) He said he would provide information about
when he filed some of his tax returns after his hearing. (Tr. 52) At the time of his hearing,
he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for TY 2021; he had not requested an
extension; and he said he needs additional documentation to get his tax return filed. (Tr.
53-55) On September 17, 2022, Applicant paid a bill of $275 for  preparation of one or
more tax returns. (AE E) This is apparently a receipt for preparation of his TY 2021 federal
and state income tax returns. Applicant said all of his tax debts were paid. (Tr. 50)
In sum, Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for
TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. There was no evidence presented  that he requested
any filing extensions. Applicant said he failed to timely file several tax returns because of
“neglect” and a lack of a “sense of urgency.” (Tr. 51) He suspected that he owed the IRS,
and he delayed filing his tax returns. (Tr. 51) His federal income taxes for TY 2011 were
not paid until 2018, and his federal income taxes for TY 2014 were not paid until April 15,
2021, when part of his refund for TY 2020 was transferred to address his TY 2014 tax
debt.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.j allege Applicant has six U.S. Department of Education (D.
ED.)  student  loan  debts  totaling  $35,398  in  collections  for  $9,282,  $5,052,  $10,163,
$1,418, $2,501, and $6,982. (Tr. 25; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 2-3; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 7 at 5; GE
11 at 2; GE 12)
Applicant said he  attempted  to  get his student loans forgiven; however, he  learned
he  was not eligible  to  have  his student loans  forgiven. (Tr. 58)  He intends to   pursue  a
master’s degree. (Tr.  58) Once  he  starts his master’s program, he  will  be  able  to  obtain a
forbearance  on  his student  loans. (Tr. 100) He  intends  to  pay  his student loans.  (Tr.  58)
He has  not made  any  payments  to  address his student  loans  since  about 2017. (Tr. 62-
63)  He did not present  documentary evidence to show his most recent payments.
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the
Department  of  Education  (D.ED.)  to  place  federal  student  loans  in  forbearance.  The
federal  government  extended  the  student  loan  payment  pause  through  December  31,
2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension
of  loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans.  See
Federal  Student  Aid  website,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
The   President   announced   forgiveness  of   $10,000   or  $20,000   of   student  loan   debt;
however,  this  program  is  currently   on   hold   due   to   litigation   in   the   8th   Circuit  Court  of
Appeals.  See  Desiree  Montilla,  “Experts weigh  in on  temporary  hold  placed  on  student
loan   forgiveness  plan,”  (Oct.  24,   2022),  https://www.nbc12.com/2022/10/24/experts-

SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a charged-off debt for $22,619. (GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 4; GE 7 at
6;  GE  11 at 2; GE 12)  Applicant was  in  an accident, and his car was  damaged  to the
extent that it was not economically repairable. (Tr. 63 106) He was injured in the accident;
however, he did not indicate  that he lost income due to the accident. (Tr. 106) His car
insurance had lapsed, and he acknowledged his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 64) He
said he made two payments on his loan to purchase the vehicle, and then the creditor
advised him the debt was charged off. (Tr. 64-65) He said the creditor stopped accepting
payments. (Tr. 67) He intends to pay this debt. (Tr. 65) He said he would try to get some
documentation  about  the  debt  after  the  hearing;  however,  he  did  not  provide  anything
about this debt after the hearing. (Tr. 68)
Applicant received  financial counseling  as part of  the  bankruptcy  process. (GE 2
at  61)  He  maintains   a   budget.   (Tr.  99)  He   has  about  $40,000   in   his  401k   retirement
account.  (Tr. 102) He has about $1,500  monthly  remaining  after paying  his expenses. (Tr.
99) He  intends  to  use  the  $1,500  monthly  discretionary  income  or remainder to  assist his
son  with  his college  expenses, to  travel to  his son’s sports events,  and  to  pay  for his son’s
car. (Tr. 100-101)
Sexual Behavior,  Personal Conduct, and Information Technology
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges under the  sexual behavior guideline  that  Applicant videotaped
women’s buttocks  and  genital areas without  their  knowledge  or consent  prior to  October
2017  for sexual gratification.  (GE 8)
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant received a
corrective action memo (CAM) in about December 2017, from his employer for: allowing
his employer-issued phone (EIP) to be accessed by a non-employee; failing to take steps
to secure his password; and recording videos of sexually explicit material on his EIP. (Tr.
87; GE 8; GE 9 at 6)
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant failed to
report to his facility security officer (FSO) that his former girlfriend stole his EIP until she
attempted to extort him for rent.
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant used his
EIP to view pornography from about January 2017 to about November 2017.
SOR  ¶  3.d  cross  alleges  under the  personal conduct  guideline  the  allegation  in
SOR ¶ 2.a.
SOR ¶ 4.a cross alleges under the information technology guideline the allegations
in SOR ¶¶ 3.a to 3.d.
Applicant videotaped women’s buttocks and genital areas prior to October 2017.
(Tr. 77, 91) According to the employer’s report, “The women pictured were fully clothed”
in the 25 videos found on Applicant’s EIP. (GE 9 at 6) About half of the videos were taken
of  several  women  at  stores  and  at  a  children’s  school.  (GE  9  at  19)  At  his  hearing,
Applicant claimed the videos were of only three women: his girlfriend, his fiancée, and a
woman in a store. (Tr. 78, 119) The 25 videos of women showed them wearing various
articles of clothing and of the crotch of one of the women while she was sitting facing him.
(Tr. 118) At his hearing, he said he used his personal cellphone and not his EIP to take
the  pictures  or  videos  of  the  women’s  buttocks  and  genitals.  (Tr.  92)  However,  his
employer’s report stated Applicant “admitted taking the videos using his [EIP] within the
last few months leading up to the investigation when his personal cell phone was broken.”
(GE 9 at 6)
Applicant  claimed   all   of   the   videos  were  with   the   consent  of   the   women   except
when   he   videotaped   one   woman   walking   in a   store  without   her consent.  (Tr. 117-118)
Applicant  said  at   his   hearing   that   the   woman   he   videotaped   in   the   store  was  wearing
slacks.  (Tr. 118) His girlfriend  said the  video  of  her was taken  without her consent,  and
she   said   multiple   women   were  videotaped   in   stores.   (GE   9   at  6)  He  denied   that  the
pictures he  took were pornographic.  (Tr. 80) He said  “Everybody  was fully  clothed.” (Tr.
80)  He said he  would provide  a  statement after his hearing  from  his fiancée  indicating  the
videos of  her body  were  made  with  her consent;  however, he  did not  provide  a  statement
from  her or an  explanation  for why  he  failed  to  provide  it. (Tr. 122) The  pictures  or videos
were not part of the  security  file  provided  to  me.  The  employer report indicated  no  nude
photographs were found on his EIP.
Applicant said he was trading his personal cell phone in for a replacement, and he
downloaded  his  pictures  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a  onto  his  EIP.  (Tr.  75,  84)  He  also  had
pornography  on  his  personal  cell  phone  that  he  transferred  to  his  EIP;  however,  his
employer’s  report did not describe  any pornography found on his EIP. (Tr. 83-84) The
employer  report  described  the  pictures  and  videos  as  “inappropriate”  rather  than  as
pornographic. He said he wanted to preserve the pornography on his EIP so that he could
transfer it back to his new privately-owned phone. (Tr. 83, 92) He used the pornography
to  enable him  to  get  sexually aroused.  (Tr. 83)  At  his hearing,  he said  he  was  unsure
whether he used his EIP to view the pornography that he transferred from his personal
phone. (Tr. 84-85) He did not define the term “pornography.”
As to how his girlfriend obtained possession of his EIP, Applicant’s girlfriend was
visiting him. (Tr. 72-73) He knew her cell phone was broken, and she needed a cell phone.
(Tr. 72-73) He went to check on his son, and he left his girlfriend in the kitchen where his
EIP was located. (Tr. 73) When Applicant returned to the kitchen, his girlfriend was gone.
(Tr.  73)  Later  in  the  evening,  his  girlfriend  called  him,  and  Applicant  realized  she  was
using  his EIP.  (Tr.  74) He  left  his password  behind  the foam  padding  of  the  container
holding his EIP. (Tr. 74-75) She said she was going to use his EIP to conduct some of
her own business. (Tr. 74) She did not have access to classified information on the EIP.
(Tr.  75)  Applicant’s  girlfriend  returned  the  EIP  the  day  after  she  took  it.  (Tr.  79,  94)
Applicant  did  not  report  her  accessing  his  EIP  because  he  did  not  believe  she  could
access classified information on his EIP. (Tr. 94) His former girlfriend attempted to extort
rent of about $1,100 from him in return for her silence about the sexual videos on his EIP.
(Tr. 88; GE 10 at 2) Applicant refused to pay her to keep her from reporting the videos on
his EIP. (Id.)
Applicant learned that his employer knew about the incident involving his EIP when
his manager told him that a woman made allegations against him, and they wanted to
check his EIP. (Tr. 86) When he received the CAM, a manager told him that he made the
right decision when he chose not to give in to the woman’s extortion, and management
still  considered  him  to  be  a  trustworthy  employee.  (Tr.  88)  In  addition  to  the  CAM,
Applicant received about seven days of suspension from work without pay. (Tr. 87-88)
Applicant knew it was wrong to use his EIP to make and store videos of women’s buttocks.
(GE 9 at 8) Applicant told his employer that he did not want his fellow employees to know
about his videotaping of women’s buttocks.
Applicant’s former girlfriend also informed his Navy Reserve unit about the videos
on his EIP, and according to Applicant, his Navy Reserve unit said, “what you do is your
business, they said,  but it wasn’t our phone. It  wasn’t any of  our equipment. They said
they don’t condone that type of behavior, but that was basically it. The Navy was like, hey,
you know, this is not use. This is basically [your employer].” (Tr. 96) There is no evidence
of any adverse action from the Navy for the incident involving misuse of his EIP.

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a,  and  3.a.  He  is  51
years  old.  He  is  married  to  a  Kyrgyzstan-born,  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  has  four
children,  one  is  an  adult  from  a  previous  relationship  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Germany, and three are minors from his marriage who are solely U.S. citizens residing
with Applicant and his spouse. (Answer; Tr. at 16; GE 1, 2)
Applicant was born and raised in the United States. His parents and two siblings
were  also  born  in  and  reside  in  the  United  States.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in
1989, he  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in  2001, and he took classes toward but had not
yet earned  a  master’s  degree.  He served honorably in the U.S.  Army from September
1991 to August 1997; in the National Guard from August 2001 to September 2002; and
in the Reserve from August  2001 to October 2003. He has since worked  overseas for
various DOD contractors, with the exception of two periods of unemployment from June
2012 to March 2013 and April 2014 to February 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he
worked  overseas  in  information  technology  for  his  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since
December 2016. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1991. (Answer; Tr. at
5-6, 16-20, 63-67, 74-76; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  43-year-old  spouse  was  born  in  Kyrgyzstan.  When  she  was  in  high
school  or  college,  she  fulfilled  her  mandatory  one-year  service  with  the  Kyrgyzstan
military.  She  does  not  have  any  other  affiliations  with  the  Kyrgyzstan  military  or
government. When Applicant worked in Kyrgyzstan between 2003 and 2011, he met his
spouse there in 2004, through a mutual friend. They married in Kyrgyzstan in 2009. She
became a naturalized U.S. citizen and  was issued a U.S. passport in May 2010.  They
married  in  the  United  States  in  2013,  because  the  foreign  country  in  which  Applicant
worked at the time did not accept his Kyrgyzstan marriage certificate. Their two eldest
children were born in Kyrgyzstan, and their youngest child was born in another foreign
country where Applicant worked at the time. As previously discussed, all three children
are solely U.S. citizens, residing with Applicant and his spouse. Throughout the duration
of   their   marriage,  and   as  of   the   date   of   the   hearing,  Applicant’s  spouse   worked   on   a
U.S.  military   base.  She   is  aware  that  Applicant  works  in  information   technology   and
holds   a   security   clearance.   Applicant  has   discussed   with   her  the   importance   of  not
sharing  this information  with  anyone. (Answer; Tr. at  15-16, 20-25, 48-51,  63-74, 79-81;
GE 1, 2)
Foreign Influence
Applicant’s  elderly  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Kyrgyzstan.  They  are  78  and  73  years  old,  respectively.  Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  a
retired  taxi  driver  and  his  mother-in-law  is  a  retired  factory  worker.  Now  farmers  in  a
rural  area,  they  own  the  home  in  which  they  live.  They  receive  a  pension  of
approximately  $200  monthly,  but  they  do  not  have  any  other  affiliation  with  the
Kyrgyzstan government. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
For a brief period in 2011, Applicant’s spouse  and  their two eldest children lived
with  her  parents  in  Kyrgyzstan,  while  Applicant  worked  in  a  country  that  was  not
conducive to his family joining him. He then moved with his family to the United States
in  2011.  He  and  his  family  traveled  to  Kyrgyzstan  to  visit  his  parents-in-law  in  2011,
twice in 2012, and in 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  spouse  has  weekly  telephonic  contact  with  her  parents.  Applicant
occasionally  talks  with  his  parents-in-law,  on  birthdays  and  during  holidays,  when  his
spouse  talks  to  her  parents.  His  spouse  usually  translates  for  him  since  he  speaks
minimal  Russian.  Applicant  manages  the  finances  in  his  household,  and  he  and  his
spouse gift her parents approximately $100 to $200 for their birthdays. Applicant stated
that his parents-in-law do not know what he does for a living. He testified that he would
report to the U.S. authorities any attempt by anyone in Kyrgyzstan to exploit his parents-
in-law  for  information  about  him.  He  has  complied  with  his  employer’s  reporting
requirements  for  foreign  contacts.  (Answer;  Tr.  at  20-29,  48-52,  60-74,  76-79,  81-89;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant has never owned property in Kyrgyzstan. When he met his spouse, she
lived  in  a  studio  apartment  in  Kyrgyzstan  gifted  to  her  by  her  parents.  She  and  her
parents  sold  this  property  for  approximately  $25,000  USD.  They  used  the  proceeds
from the sale, along with $25,000 USD that Applicant gave to his spouse, to purchase a
one-bedroom  apartment  in  Kyrgyzstan  in  September  2010  for  $55,000  USD.  This
property is solely  in  Applicant’s  mother-in-law’s name.  His  parents-in-laws  rent  out  the
apartment  and  use  the  rental  income,  of  approximately  $200  monthly,  for  living
expenses. (Answer; Tr. at 20, 25-26, 29, 51-60, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s spouse does not have any intention to manage  her parent’s property
in  Kyrgyzstan  once  her parents are  unable to  do  so.  Neither Applicant  nor his spouse
have any financial interest in this property. Applicant anticipates that his brother-in-law,
who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Kyrgyzstan,  will  assume  those  responsibilities.
Applicant’s  spouse  has  minimal  contact  with  her  brother.  Applicant  is  unsure  what  his
brother-in-law  does  for  a  living,  but  stated  that  he  is  not  affiliated  with  the  Kyrgyzstan
government or military and he helps his parents on their farm. (Answer; Tr. at 20, 25-26,
29, 51-60, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  listed  in  his  March  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  that  he
purchased a home in the United States in April 2014. He resided in this home from April
2014  until  March  2015.  His  brother  occasionally  lived  in  this  home  while  Applicant
worked  overseas.  It  is  unclear  from  the  record  if  Applicant  still  owns  this  home.  The
record does not contain any evidence of any other U.S.-based assets. (GE 1)
Misuse of Information Technology and Personal Conduct
In  June  2016,  Applicant  downloaded  and  viewed  pornographic  material  on  his
corporate laptop in violation of  company policy. He had been working  overseas for his
then-employer, as a federal systems technologist, since approximately January 2015. At
the time of the incident, he was away from his spouse; his personal laptop was broken;
and  he  used  his  work  laptop  to  download  and  view  pornography  at  his  spouse’s
suggestion while she was on the phone with him. Although he had previously used his
work  laptop  for  personal  reasons,  this  was  the  only  instance  in  which  he  did  so  for
pornography.  He  did  not  engage  in  this  activity  over  a  U.S.  Government  network.  His
supervisor  notified  him  in  November  2016  that  he  violated  company  policy  by
downloading  inappropriate  material  on  his  company  computer,  and  he  accepted  his
supervisor’s offer to  resign  in lieu of termination. His employer kept him on board until
they found his replacement in December 2016. (Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 19, 26-48, 66-67,
89-107; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  disclosed  this  information  to  his  spouse,  on  his  SCA,  and  during  his
October  2017  background  interview.  Although  he  used  his  work  laptop  and  personal
laptop  interchangeably,  he acknowledged  that  he  exercised bad  judgment  in using his
work laptop to download and view pornography and he should have known better since
he  works  in  information  technology.  He  did  not  have  any  previous  incidents  of
unauthorized use of  information technology,  and  as of  the date of the hearing,  he had
not  had  any  subsequent  such  incidents.  He  received  bi-annual  training  from  his
employer on the rules governing the use of his work computer, and he was aware that
his employer prohibited  personal use  of his work computer.  (Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 19,
26-48, 66-67, 89-107; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  earned  various  information  technology  certificates,  to  include  his
CISCO certified network associate routing and switching in 2019. He provided letters of
support  from  three  individuals  who  attested  to  his  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and
judgment. One individual, a retired Lieutenant Commander from the U.S. Navy, came to
know  Applicant  in  2016,  when  Applicant  served  under  his  department  in  providing
classified  and  unclassified  network  support  to  military  warfighters.  They  subsequently
became  colleagues  in  2017,  and  he  associated  with  Applicant  professionally  and
personally. The other two individuals were colleagues who have known Applicant since
2016 and 2019, respectively. (Answer)

"Applicant is 29 years old.  He is married with  no  children.  He has a Bachelor’s
degree.  He  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  an  Engineer.  He  is  seeking  to
obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline M –  Use of Information Technology
Prior to his current employment, Applicant worked for another defense contractor
from  May  2015  to  July  2018  at  which  time,  due  to  his  misconduct  and  violations  of
company  policies,  Applicant  agreed  to  resign  in  lieu  of  termination.  Applicant  began
working for his current employer in August 2019.
The SOR alleged the following misconduct:
1.a.  On multiple occasions between November 2017 and July 2018 Applicant used his
company  computer  (laptop)  to  stream  and  view  pornographic  videos  and/or  images
(sexually  explicit  material)  in  violation  of  company  policy.  (See  Applicant’s  Answer  to
the SOR.)
1.b.  Applicant  used  the  “InPrivate  Browsing”  mode  while  using  the  internet  explorer
browser  to  stream  and  view  the  explicit  pornographic  videos  and  images  to  evade
detection of websites he visited while surfing the internet.  The InPrivate Browsing mode
allowed him to surf the internet without leaving a digital footprint such as the browsing
history, temporary internet files, form data and cookies, which are not retained when the

his behavior knowing it was in violation of company policy.
1.c.  Applicant introduced malware computer viruses onto the company’s IT System by
using his company assigned computer to stream and view pornographic videos and/or
images via his YouTube and Instagram accounts.  Applicant explained that he realized
that he had identified a loophole of sorts where his identity was not associated  with his
internet  browsing.  He  states  that  he  removed  his  own  access  to  the  resources  in  a
voluntary  attempt  to  end  his  misconduct  on  his  own,  however  his  misconduct  was
identified  by  his  employer  when  he  began  accessing  sexual  content  through  his
personal  computer’s  direct  network  connection  and  inadvertently  introduced  malware.
He states that it was through the remote server and desktop emulator that he was able
to access sexually explicit content at work without discovery dating back to 2017.

2.c.  At the conclusion of the company’s investigation, Applicant was given an option to
resign in lieu of being terminated form employment for his acts of misconduct described
above.  Applicant opted to resign.  He is not eligible for rehire.
2.d.  Applicant  provided  false  or  misleading  statements  to  the  Department  of  Defense
investigators  during  his  interviews  in  February  and  March  2020,  by  stating  that  he
thought  because  the  site  was  not  blocked,  it  was  acceptable  to  view  content from  the
site; when in fact he knew viewing explicit content of this sort was not acceptable and
that others had gotten into trouble for viewing similar content.
2.e.  Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  dated  March  29,  2019,  and
December  6,  2019.
In  response  to  Section  13A,  which  asked  him  about  his
“Employment  Activities,”  Applicant  provided  the  reason  for  leaving  his  previous
employment as there being no long-term career path following an incident involving an
inadvertent  accessing  of  malware  embedded  in  a  YouTube  video  while  at  work.  He
stated  that  he  had  no  knowledge  that  the  YouTube  video  had  malware  embedded,  or
that  one  could  embed  malware  in  a  YouTube  video.  Applicant  was  not  truthful  in  his
response.  Applicant  failed  to  state  the  true  reason  he  left.  He  left  in  lieu  being
terminated.  Applicant took the option to resign in lieu of being terminated for cause by
his company for acts of misconduct described in paragraph 1, above.
2.f.   The  same  questionnaire,  also  asked  Applicant  under  Section  13A,  entitled,
“Received  Discipline  or  Warning”,  about  the  particulars  of  the  discipline  he  received.
Applicant stated that he was suspended with pay for roughly two weeks for the incident,
and that the investigation into the incident  with malware  was accessed via a YouTube
video.  Applicant claims that the suspension was with pay, and that it was therefore not
considered to be an action of formal discipline by the company.  He further stated that
he wanted to be honest and forthcoming with his answer.  Applicant was not truthful in
his  response.  Applicant’s  misconduct  instigated  a  formal  investigation  that  concluded
that he violated company policy, resulting in his job termination.  In lieu  of termination,
Applicant was suspended without pay during the investigation period, and the company
would have fired him for cause had he not taken the option they gave him to resign.
Applicant now acknowledges his sexual addiction, which he believes stems from
his  childhood trauma  of  being molested.  He  admits that he  initially attempted to  deny
his  behavior  and  tried  to  maintain  secrecy  until  he  could  no  longer  keep  his  problem
secret.  He admits now that he always knew his actions were wrong, and in violation of
company  policy.  He  lied  to  investigators  not  only  to  avoid  the  consequences  of  his
actions,  but  to  avoid  the  shame,  pain,  and  embarrassment  of  being  in  front  of  others
and having them know his situation.  (Applicant’s Response to the FORM.)
He  states  that  he  currently attends bi-weekly therapy sessions  with  his certified
sexual  addiction  therapist/counselor,  who  helps  him  to  actively  pursue  health  and
freedom.  He is a member of a sexual addiction support group, is working the program,
and  is  accountable  to  other  group  members.  After  living  with  his  addiction  for  many
years, he believes he has successfully broken the addictive cycle thanks to the help and
support of his counselors, support group, and personal support network.  He stated that
he is committed to ongoing sexual health.  (Applicant’s Response to the FORM.)
A  letter  from  Applicant’s  counselor  dated  February  15,  2022,  indicates  that
Applicant  was  referred  by  the  pastor  of  his  church  for  his  long-standing  pornography
addiction.  Applicant  received  a  total  of  eleven  sessions  of  individual  or  marriage
counseling  between  February  27,  2017,  and  February  7,  2022,  when  his  attorney
requested a summary of the counseling.  Applicant is said to have made progress with
his addiction before his wife moved out of state.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)
A  letter from  Applicant’s biblical counselor, who provided help to  Applicant from
2017  to  2019,  indicates  that  in  his  opinion,  Applicant  has  stopped  engaging  in
pornography  and  now  realizes  the  wrong,  foolishness,  and  harm  it  has  caused  to  his
wife  and  others.  Applicant  also  appears  to  understand  the  dangers  pornography  can
have to his personal and professional life.  (Applicant’s Exhibit E.)
Numerous  letters  of  recommendation  from  various  individuals  who  know  the
Applicant  well,  and  some  of  whom  have  worked  closely  with  Applicant  attest  to  his
exemplary  behavior,  integrity,  reliability  and  trustworthiness.  They  all  support  his
request for access to classified information.  (Applicant’s Exhibits O through X.)

He has also received two master’s degree, one in computer science (2000) and a second

Paragraph 1  –  Guideline K, Handling Protected Information
The Government alleges two incidents in which Applicant failed to comply with his
employer’s  rules  and  regulations  for  handling  protected  information.  Both  incidents
occurred in 2019 and involved Applicant’s use of his work computer while in Mexico. After
the first incident in January 2019, he was verbally warned by his employer (Company A)
that  his  use  of  a  company  computer  on  an  Internet  network  while  he  was  in  Mexico
violated company policy (SOR 1.a). After he again used his work computer in Mexico in
February 2019, he was terminated (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted both allegations in his
Answer.
The details regarding these two incidents developed by the record evidence are
the following:
1.a  Verbal warning. At the hearing Applicant admitted that he violated the policy of
Company A by connecting his employer’s computer to an Internet network when he was
in Mexico visiting  his wife  and  child  in January  2019. At that time  he  was living  near the
Mexican  border  and  his wife  was living  and  working  in Mexico  near the  border. His young
child  was living  with  Applicant’s wife. He  crossed  the  border “continuously” to  see  his child
and  wife. Applicant worked  from  his home  in the  United  States, but also worked  in Mexico
when  visiting  his family. His work required  that he  connect  his computer to  the  internet
when   he   was  working   in  Mexico.   Company   A   discovered   that  he   was  logging   onto   its
computer network from  a  location  in  Mexico. He used  his wife’s Wi-Fi  system  to  access
the  internet.  At first he  did not know  that his actions violated  company  policy. He testified
that   he   was  merely   trying   to   fulfill   his   family   obligations  and   do   his   job.   His  supervisor
counseled  him  that his actions violated company policy.  (Tr. at 28-37.)
1.b   Employment  termination.  The  next  month  Applicant  repeated  his  action  of
connecting  his  company  computer  to  the  internet  while  visiting  his  family  in  Mexico.
Company  A  terminated  him.  At  the  hearing  he  admitted  that  he  knowingly  violated
company policy. (Tr. at 37- 39.)
Paragraph 2  –  Guideline M,  Use of  Information Technology
In this paragraph of the SOR, the Government alleges two separate incidents  in
November  2014  involving  Applicant’s  use  of  his  work  computer  in  violation  of  another
employer’s  (Company B) policy (SOR 2.a and  2.b). In addition  the Government  cross-
alleges the two aforementioned incidents involving connecting to an Internet network in
Mexico, as set forth in paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of the SOR (SOR 2.c).
The details regarding the two incidents in 2014 are the following:
2.a   Written   counseling.  On   November  4,   2014,   Applicant   received   written
counseling   from   his  supervisor  at  Company   B   for  failing   to   communicate   with   his
supervisor  effectively   and   for   loading   software  onto   his  work  computer  in   violation   of
Company  B’s policy.  In  his  Answer, Applicant denied  the  allegation  claiming  that  he  did
not  receive   any   counseling.  At  the   hearing   he   testified   that  he   did  not  recall   being
counselled   by   his  supervisor.  He  did  recall   that  his  supervisor  asked   that  employees
provide  him  with  a  list of  all  the  software loaded  on  their  computers and  he  determined
that   Applicant’s   list  was  incomplete.   Applicant  was  advised   that  his  actions  were
unacceptable   and   against   company   policy.  Applicant   then   removed   the   disallowed
software from  his company  computer after being  “yelled” at by  his supervisor. (Tr. at 40-
44; GE 3.)
2.b   Employment  termination.   On  November  20,  2014,  Company  B  terminated
Applicant  for his  failure  to  communicate  with  company  staff  and  management  about  a
serious error Applicant made to a client’s online system.  Applicant testified that he was
using a client’s database and he “mistakenly removed some information.” He testified that
he was questioned about his mistake. He believes the mistake was due to lack of training.
He did not initially admit his mistake, but “at the end of the day” he  “actually fessed up
and said, hey, this was my mistake” after checking his work further. He admitted that he
did not self-report his mistake. It was discovered  by  Company  B’s  client and the client
reported the error to Applicant’s supervisor. Applicant was terminated at that time. (Tr. at
44-46.)
2.c Cross allegations. The SOR cross alleges the allegations set forth in paragraph
1 of the SOR under Guideline K in this subparagraph under Guideline M.
Paragraph 3  - Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The   Government   alleges  two   instances  in   which  Applicant   provided   false
information in  his 2015 e-QIP.  Both  falsifications relate to his 2014 written warning (SOR
3.a) and  employment termination   (SOR 3.b),  which  Applicant did  not disclose  in  his e-
QIP, as required. In  both  allegations, the  Government alleges that the  omissions in the  e-
QIP   were  deliberate.   The   Government   also   cross-alleges  under  Guideline   E   the
allegations  set  forth   in   SOR   subparagraphs  1.a,  1.b,   2.a,   and   2.b.   In   his  Answer  he
admitted the  falsification allegations and provided  additional comments.
The details regarding the two falsification allegations are the following:
3.a   Failure   to   disclose   November  2014   employment   termination   for  cause.   In
Section 13A of the e-QIP Applicant was required to provide the reason for his termination
from  Company  B  in  November  2014.  He  responded  by  writing,  “I  was  laid  off  due  to
company  downsizing.”  At  the  hearing  Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  response  was
false. He explained he did not “want to remember that chapter,” but he said that  he told
the investigator the truth. An investigator in or about 2016 first interviewed applicant. The
interview following his submission of the e-QIP in November 2015 is not in the record.
(Tr. at 46-47; GE 1 at 13.)
3.b  Failure to  disclose  November 2014  written  warning  from  Company  B  and  his
termination, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b. Another question in Section 13A of the e-
QIP asks for disclosure about receiving any written warnings from Employer B or being
“officially  reprimanded,  suspended,  or  disciplined  for  misconduct  in  the  workplace.”
Applicant responded “No.” At the hearing, he explained that he made a mistake and used
“bad judgment” by falsely answering this question. He also testified that he disclosed his
termination during his two background interviews. Only the most recent interview, which
took place in September 2019, appears in the record. In  the investigator’s summary of
Applicant’s  2019  interview,  the  investigator  noted  that  Applicant  discussed  his  2014
termination by Company B and commented that Applicant stated he provided information
regarding that incident in his first interview after the submission of his 2015 e-QIP. (Tr. at
47-48; GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 4.)
Paragraph 4  –  Foreign Influence
In paragraph 4 of the SOR, the Government alleges that Applicant’s wife is a citizen
and resident of Mexico and is employed by a Mexican public safety organization. In his
Answer  Applicant  denied  the  allegation  and  commented  that  his  wife  is  no  longer
employed.
The details regarding this allegation are the following:
4.a   Mexican   citizenship,   residency,  and   employment  of  Applicant’s  wife.
Applicant’s wife is a Mexican citizen and resides in Mexico. She has a U.S. tourist visa
that permits her to visit Applicant at his residence in the United States. She is no longer
employed, but she previously worked  in a small office in her city that runs a non-profit
organization dedicated to the safety of the residents of that municipality. In that position,
she received local government benefits, but was not an official government employee.
The organization received funding from both the city and private industry. She left her job
in or about May 2002 to care for her child. At that time, she was frustrated with her job
because of the corruption of the police and politicians in her city. Her organization was
not effective in making changes to the law enforcement culture in the city. She is now a
full-time mother and studies English. The new director of her former employer continues
to  seek  advice  from  Applicant’s  wife  even  though  she  is  no  longer  employed  at  that
organization. Applicant, his wife, and their child travel back and forth across the Mexican
border regularly. He estimated that he travels to Mexico about three times per week. He
does  not  do  any  work  while  he  is  in  Mexico.  Applicant  is  helping  his  wife  apply  for
permanent residency status in the United States. (Tr. at 49-60.)
Mitigation
Applicant testified that he made mistakes in the past, but that he has learned from
his mistakes. He has changed his behavior based upon what he learned. He believes that
he has done well the last three years complying with all rules and policies of his employers
and  performing  his  job  well.  Applicant  provided  three  reference  letters.  His  current
manager wrote about Applicant’s excellent job performance and value to his team. The
CEO of Applicant’s former employer (Company C) also praised Applicant’s performance
and  professionalism.  This  reference  noted  that  he  hired  Applicant  in  2019  with  full
knowledge  of Applicant’s termination from  Company A in 2019 and the reasons for his
termination.  He  affirmed  that  Applicant  has  learned  from  his  past  mistakes  and  fully
complied with all security directives and policies during his work for Company C. He also
commented that he would hire Applicant again based upon his performance. In addition
a former supervisor wrote that Applicant was trustworthy and reliable. (Tr. at 61, 70; AE
A; AE B; AE C.)

"Applicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  August  20,  2020.  (AppX  I.)
Applicant is married, but separated from his current spouse, and has two children. (GX
1 at pages 18~19, and 22~23.) He served in the Marine Corps as an enlisted member,
and was honorably discharged. (TR at page 15 lines 9~20.)
Guideline   M   -  Use   of  Information  Technology,   Guideline   D   -  Sexual  Behavior   &
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a.,  2.a.  and  3.a.  Applicant  admits  that  beginning  in  at  least  January  2018,  he
used  his  Government-Issued  computer  to  store  and  view  images  containing  sexually
explicit,  sexually  orientated,  and/or  inappropriate  content.  (TR  at  page  17  line  12  to
page  23  line  17.) As a  result  of  this,  on  June  3,  2019,  Applicant was  suspended  from
duty and pay for 14 days, for Misuse of a Government Computer.  (TR at page 34 line 8
to page 35 line 2.) He was further advised that any further misconduct may result in a
more severe disciplinary action. (GX 3.)
1.b., 2.a. and 3.a. Applicant admits that from July 2019 to at least April 2020, he
again  used  his  Government  computer  to  store  and  view  images  containing  sexually
explicit,  sexually  orientated,  and/or  inappropriate  content.  (TR  at  page  24  line  16  to
page  31  line  6.)  As  a  result  of  this  misconduct,  on  June  16,  2020,  Applicant  was
terminated  from  his  place  of  employment,  and  thereby  removed  from  Federal  service.
(GXs 6~9.)
Most  recently,  in  September  of  2022,  a  Doctor  of  Psychology  determined
Applicant  to  be  suffering  from  “compulsive  behavior,”  but  not  from  a  “compulsive
disorder.”  She also averred, in part, the following: “I feel his lapse in judgment was the
product of severe and atypical psychosocial stressors the specific nature of which he is
unlikely  to  again  experience.”  The  Doctor  further  averred:  “the  preponderance  of  the
evidence in this case suggests that . . . [Applicant] is a reliable, ethical, and trustworthy
employee.” (AppX M.)

Applicant  became  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  a  company  (hereinafter
“Company”) in 2016. Terms of his employment included that he could be terminated for
cause  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including  “commission  of  any  other  act  that  is,  in  the
Board’s good faith judgment, reasonably likely to bring you, the Company or its affiliates
into  disgrace  or  public  disrepute  or  materially  harm  its  or  their  goodwill  or  business
reputation or that of it’s or their employees, officers, directors or customers,” and “failure
to  obtain  or  maintain  all  security  clearances  required  for  the  performance  of  your
duties.”  He  held  security  clearances  in  the  past,  but  it  is  unclear  if  he  had  one  at  the
Company before he was granted a clearance in 2017. (Tr. at 29, 45-46; GE 4)
Applicant  is  a longtime  photographer. He sometimes  used a  pseudonym for his
photography  and for  social media accounts.  He  did  photo  shoots of  women  who  were
scantily clad or in their underwear. He stated that he did not do nude photography, the
photos were essentially what could be found on the cover of a legitimate magazine, and
the  women  wore  more  clothes  than  what  would  be  found  on  the  average  beach.  He
stated that his wife was aware that he did the shoots and even helped arrange some of
them. (Tr. at 27-29, 52-54, 65-67; AE A, C, D, R)
In about 2015, Applicant met a woman (Ms. A) online. They interacted online and
met in person twice in 2017, once in the United States while he was on a business trip
and once in the United Kingdom  (UK). He was in the UK with his family. He stayed in
the  UK  for  work  after  his  family  left,  and  he  met  Ms.  A.  He  agreed  to  a  photography
session  with  her  that  was  supposed  to  include  a  male  model,  but  the  male  model
cancelled. He took about 30 to 40 shots. He stated that she took off her top at one point,
but  she  was  covered  by  a  sheet  or  blanket.  He  denied  that  it  was  an  “erotic  photo
shoot.”  He uploaded the photos to a drop box account and shared the link with Ms. A.
He stated that a few weeks later, per her request, he deleted all images he had of her.
(Tr. at 28, 32, 47-52, 55-58; GE 3, 14; AE A, K)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  an  online  “affair”  with  Ms.  A  that  included
“sexting,”  but  he  denied  that  there  was  ever  any  physical  contact.  He  stated  that  he
broke off the relationship in 2017 after a family member passed away, and he became
recommitted to his family. He told his wife about the affair, and he thought that was the
end of it. (Tr. at 31-32, 41-42, 50, 54, 67-68; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE A,
O, W)
Applicant  received  a  demand  letter  from  Ms.  A’s  attorney  in  October  2017.  It
included a proposed settlement agreement in which Applicant would pay a set amount if
any  of  her  images  appear  online.  Applicant’s  wife  described  Ms.  A’s  actions  as
threatening,  and  that  they  “felt  bullied  and  it  was  bordering  on blackmail.”  He  retained
an attorney who responded to the demand letter. He refused the settlement agreement.
The  attorney  wrote  that  against  his  advice,  Applicant  was  “willing  to  pay  a  de  minimis
amount  to  Ms.  [A]  in  exchange  for  her  promise  never  to  contact  him  again  and  to
likewise delete any of his photos in  her possession.” Applicant  stated  that they  did  not
hear back from Ms. A, and he thought the matter was over. (Tr. at 54-60; GE 9; AE O)
Ms. A’s attorney contacted Applicant’s employer in 2018. The attorney stated that
Applicant  pursued  a  relationship  with  Ms.  A  for  several  years  before  their  relationship
that  culminated  in  sex  during  a  business  trip  to  the  United  Kingdom.  The  attorney
indicated  that  Applicant  took  a  naked  picture  and  other  intimate  pictures  of  Ms.  A
without  her  consent.  The  attorney  indicated  that  Applicant  used  the  company’s
electronic devices to communicate with Ms. A, and that he told her that he was doing so
at home, at work, and while traveling for business. The attorney stated that Ms. A was
not seeking monetary compensation, but that she wanted “to make sure [Applicant] has
none of her images and that none of her images are saved  elsewhere (for example on
[Company’s] computers or phone).”1 (GE 10)
The attorney also referenced that Applicant posed as a photographer to convince
young  women  to  undress  for  him,  and  that  he  distributed  the  materials  without  the
individuals’  consent.  The  attorney  indicated  that  Applicant  told  Ms.  A  that  underage
women had lied to him about their age. (GE 10)
The  Company  retained  a  professional  to  conduct  a  forensic  examination  of
Applicant’s  work  phone  and  laptop.  Numerous  adult  and  pornographic  websites  were
apparently accessed through the phone. Nothing of significance was accessed through
the  laptop.  A  picture  of  a  clothed  man  (Applicant)  taking  a  picture  through  a  mirror  of
himself and a woman in her underwear (not Ms. A and not Applicant’s wife) were found
through  the  phone.  Applicant  testified  that  the  photo  was  taken  in  2014,  and  his  wife
was aware that he did the shoot, and his wife may have helped with the styling. (Tr. at
52-54; GE 11, 12, 15)
Applicant  asserted  that  at  the  Company’s  request,  when  he  first  started  at  the
Company,  his  personal  phone  and  account  were  synched  to  his  work  phone,  which
made  everything  he  did  on  his  personal  devices  available  through  his  work  phone.
Without getting too much into the technical realm, that statement is accepted. He stated
that  he  never  used  the  work  phone  to  view  anything  inappropriate,  and  that  all  of  the
searches were conducted on his personal phone and may have been done by his son.

1  As indicated in the Statement of the Case, I am not considering any matter in the letter for the truth of
any controverted issue. See Directive ¶ E3.1.22.
Applicant was advised by the Company in late October 2018  that the  Company
received  a  letter  from  Ms.  A’s  attorney  alleging  that  he  had  an  intimate  sexual
relationship with Ms. A. Applicant denied the allegation. He stated that photography was
a hobby, but not erotic photography or photography of a sexual nature, rather, he took
pictures of musical bands and other non-sexual photography. He indicated that he first
met  Ms.  A  in  a  hotel  bar  during  a  business  trip  in  May  2017.  She  approached  him
because she noticed his camera. They engaged in conversation, kept in virtual contact,
and agreed to meet in the United Kingdom when they both separately were going to be
there. While there, he took about 30 photos of her, which did not involve nudity, but she
did  remove  her top.  They  had  lunch  afterwards.  He  stated  that  he  had  engaged  in  no
other behavior of a similar nature. (Tr. at 33, 60-61; GE 13, 14)
The  Company  reduced  Applicant’s  verbal  statement  to  writing.  The  Company
indicated  that  the  allegations  potentially  implicated  the  Company  and  Applicant’s
security clearance and requested a sworn affidavit by early November 2018.  Applicant
provided an affidavit in which he wrote:
Since  1985, photography is a  hobby of mine, but not erotic photography  or
photography   of   a   sexual  nature,   rather,  I   take   photos   of   family,  friends,
musical bands and  other non-sexual photography.

I  misspoke   during   our   conversation   in   [city].   In   the   moment,   I  was
shocked,  rattled,   and   embarrassed   to   find   myself  being   specifically
questioned   about  whether  I   had   sex  with   a   woman   in   a   hotel  room   by  a
member  of  the   Board.   I  had   not  met  [Ms.   A]  before   the   meeting   at   the
[hotel].  However, our occasional virtual  relationship  extended  back  before
I  joined  [Company].  She  knew I was in  [city] and  knew to  identify me  at the
hotel bar because  I had my camera with me.
*
*

I have engaged in no other behavior of a similar nature. (GE 14)
Applicant stated in the affidavit that many of the photos found on the phone were taken
by his son. (GE 14)
The  Board  of  Directors  convened  and  determined  that  there  was  a  basis  to
terminate  Applicant’s  employment  “for  cause”  due  to  lack  of  truthfulness  during  the
investigative process and because his behavior could jeopardize his ability to maintain a
security clearance. A termination letter was prepared, which stated that the conduct that
formed the basis of the termination included:
•   Engaging   in   the   creation   of  erotic  photography  and   related   activities  (together,
the “Activities”);
•   making   false  statements  to   the   Company  during   the   course  of   a   Company
investigation   concerning   the   extent  and   nature  of   and   other  details  concerning
the Activities;
•   submission   to   the   Company  of  a   sworn  affidavit  containing   false   statements
concerning the  Activities;  and
•  use  of  Company  resources,  including  a  Company-issued  iPhone,  in  connection
with the Activities, in violation of Company policy. (GE 17)
On  November  26,  2018,  the  Board  met  with  Applicant  and  showed  him  the
additional information from the forensic search of the phone, at which time he admitted
to  the  behavior  and  resigned.  The  termination  letter  was  never  issued  to  Applicant
because he resigned. (Tr. at 36-40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 18, 19; AE A, B,
E, G, L, T, V, X)
Applicant stated that he was shocked, dismayed, embarrassed, and angry when
he was first confronted by the Company, and “in the moment, [he] told them half-truths.”
He stated that he “didn’t tell them all that they wanted to know, [he] only told them parts
of what they, [he] would argue deserved to know.” Applicant asserted at his hearing that
he did not believe his resignation was because of “misconduct.” He felt it was because
he  was  “not  forthcoming”  to  the  Board.  He  stated  that  he  believes  that  if  he  was
forthcoming, he could have stayed with the Company in spite of the other issues. (Tr. at
33-35, 61, 69-71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE A)
Applicant did not intend to stay with the Company even if issues with Ms. A and
his truthfulness never came up. His family remained in another state when he relocated
to take the CEO position. He also had another business opportunity. (Tr. at 29, 32-33;
AE A, E, O, P, Q, T, V)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January 2021. Under Section 13A – Employment Activities, he reported the job with the
Company. He answered “No” to the following question:
For  this  employment  have  any  of  the  following  happened  to  you  in  the
last seven (7) years?
•   Fired
•   Quit after being  told you would be  fired
•   Left   by  mutual  agreement  following   charges  or  allegations  of
misconduct
•   Left   by  mutual  agreement
following   notice   of   unsatisfactory
performance
He wrote as the reason for leaving the job:
My  family   didn’t  relocate   to   [City  A  in   state   where   job   was  located]  and
stayed   in  [City B  in   state   where his family  lived]  when   I  took the   job   with
[Company].  Nearly  three   years  of  commuting   every  week  from   [City  B]
was  negatively  impacting   my   family  life,  especially  for  my  wife   and   two
high  school-age  daughters. I had  an  extramarital affair  during  the  first year
with  [Company]  which  I ended  in  mid-2017. My wife  is aware of this affair,
but this created  significant marital distress.  With  my  2nd  child  enlisting  in
[U.S.  military],   my  3rd   child  heading   into   her  senior   year  of  high   school,
and   my   4th   child   becoming   a   sophomore  in   HS,   in   mid-2018,   I  began
seeking   job   opportunities  in   [City  B].   In   early  November  2018,  I  had   an
agreement  in   place  to   buy   a   privately-held  company   called   [REDACTED]
and left  [Company] in December.  (GE 1)
There is nothing in the above paragraph that is clearly false. The problem is what
was  left  out.  Applicant  was  not  fired,  but  clearly  he  either  “Quit  after  being  told  you
would  be  fired”  or  “Left  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of
misconduct.”  The  answer  to  that  question  should  have  been  “Yes.”  (Tr.  at  73-74;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  submitted  another  SF  86  in  March  2021.  Most  of  the  SF  86  was
identical  to  the  January  2021  SF  86,  including  the  information  about  his  employment
with  the  Company,  but  there  were  some  minor  changes,  including  his  weight  and
information about his relatives.2 (GE 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  May  2021.  He
denied  that  he  was  terminated  from  the  Company,  which  is  correct  since  he  resigned
from the Company. He was then confronted with the inaccurate information that he was
terminated.  His  explanation  about  Ms.  A  and  his  resignation  from  the  Company  is
consistent with his testimony at his hearing. (GE 3)
Applicant submitted a third SF 86 in October 2021. He answered the Section 13A
question  appropriately,  that  he  “Left  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or
allegations of misconduct.” He provided details of his resignation from the Company and
his  involvement  with  Ms.  A,  but  he  did  not  add  that  he  was  “not  forthcoming”  to  the
Board of Directors. (Tr. at 39-40; AE Q)
Applicant stated that he has learned from the experience, and that in the future
he will overreport his answers on SF 86s. He  and his wife have received therapy, and
their marriage is strong. (Tr. at 43, 68, 80; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, O)
2  The SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified this SF 86. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR
will  not  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  used  to  assess  Applicant’s  credibility,  in  the
application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his responsibility, leadership,
trustworthiness, and integrity. (AE B, E, N, O)

"Applicant   admitted   all   the   SOR  allegations.   He  is   60   years  old.   He   was  born   in
China,  where  he   graduated   from   high   school  in  1980,  earned   an  associate   degree   in
1983, and  married  in 1987.  In  September 1995,  at age  32,  he  immigrated  to  the  United
States   and   earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   in  1999.  He   divorced   and   remarried   in  2006,
became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  in 2008, divorced  in 2011,  and  remarried  in 2012.  He
has an  adult  child  from  his first marriage, who  was born in China, became  a  naturalized
U.S. citizen,  and  resides in the  United  States. He also has a  minor child  from his current
marriage, who  was born in the  United  States  and  resides with  Applicant and  his spouse
in  the  United  States. He  has owned  his home  in  the  United  States since  October 2020.

When Applicant was solely a Chinese citizen, he held two Chinese passports that
were  issued  to  him  in  China  in  1995  and  1999,  and  which  expired  in  1997  and  2009,
respectively. When he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008, he was issued a U.S.
passport  that  expired  in  2018.  He  was  subsequently  issued  another  U.S.  passport  in
2018, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2028. In 2017, he obtained a Chinese visa
that  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  2027,  and  he  uses  this  visa,  along  with  his  U.S.
passport,  when  he  travels  to  China,  as  further  discussed  below.  (Tr.  at  31-34,  93-95,
100-103, 112-113; GE 1-2)
Applicant  worked  in  the  private  sector  from  2007  to  2015.  He  also  owned  a
health, beauty, and home care products business from 2010 to 2019. He was fired by a
previous employer in October 2015, as further discussed below. He was subsequently
unemployed until May 2016, when he first began working for a defense contractor. As of
the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  technical  support  engineer  for  his  current
employer, another defense contractor, since approximately 2017. He earned certificates
in  security  training  in  2018,  2020,  and  2021.  He  was  granted  an  interim  security
clearance in approximately 2016. (Tr. at 7-8, 23-25, 73; GE 1-3; AE H, T)
Applicant’s  51-year-old  spouse  was  born  in  China.  He  met  her  in  2011.  She
worked  as  a medical doctor in  China  before immigrating  to  the  United  States  in 2012.
As  of  Applicant’s  June 2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  she  was  a  Chinese
citizen  and  held  a  permanent  resident  card.  She  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in
January 2020. Applicant believed her previously issued Chinese passport expired. As of
the date of the hearing, she was a licensed acupuncturist  in the United States. She is
aware that Applicant is seeking a DOD security clearance. (Tr. at 34-37, 105, 127-132;

Applicant’s  father  has  been  deceased  since  2011,  and  Applicant’s  87-year-old
mother is a Chinese citizen residing in China. (SOR ¶ 4.a) She is a retired merchandise
store  worker.  She  owns  her  home,  which  is  Applicant’s  childhood  home,  the  value  of
which Applicant estimated was $58,000 USD. Applicant expects that his two sisters will
inherit  their  mother’s  home.  Occasionally,  Applicant’s  older  sister  and  her  adult  son
reside  with  her  in  her  home.  Applicant  maintains  in-person,  telephonic,  and  electronic
contact with his mother. She visited him in the United States in approximately 2001, and
he travels to China to see her approximately once every two years. He last saw her in
China in 2019, when he visited and stayed with her. He talks to her by telephone or chat
room once every two to three weeks. Applicant’s mother is aware that he underwent a
background investigation. (Tr. at 37-45, 89-90, 103-105, 107-108; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, J)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  has  been  deceased  since  2021,  and  Applicant’s  78-
year-old mother-in-law is a Chinese citizen residing in China. (SOR ¶ 4.d) His mother-in-
law was a professor at a university before she retired in 2000. She receives a pension
from  the  Chinese  government  of  approximately  $750  USD  monthly.  She  owns  the
condominium  in  which she  lives, the value  of  which  Applicant  was unaware.  Applicant
expects that his mother-in-law’s home will be inherited by his spouse and his spouse’s
sibling  upon  his  mother-in-law’s  passing.  Applicant’s  spouse  talks  to  her  mother  daily,
and  Applicant  talks  to  his  mother-in-law  two  to  three  times  monthly.  She  visited
Applicant  and  his  spouse  in  the  United  States  twice.  He  and  his  spouse  last  saw  his
mother-in-law in 2017, when they traveled to China with their child to visit. His spouse
travels  to  China  on  her  own  to  visit  her  mother,  and  she  last  did  so  in  approximately
2018. Applicant’s mother-in-law is aware that he underwent a background investigation.

Applicant’s  brother,  age  51,  and  two  sisters,  ages  59  and  54,  are  Chinese
citizens;  his  brother  lives  in  Japan  and  his  sisters  live  in  China.  (SOR  ¶¶  4.b-4.c)
Applicant’s  brother  has  lived  in  Japan  since  2010,  and  his  spouse  lives  with  him.
Applicant’s  brother  is  a  cook  in  a  restaurant,  and  his  spouse  works  in  a  hotel.
Applicant’s  sisters  work  for  a  ceramics  company.  They  are  divorced.  Applicant’s  older
sister  and  her  adult  son,  who  was  recently  laid  off  from  an  automaker  factory,  live  on
occasion  with  their  mother  in  her  home,  and  Applicant’s  older  sister  is  the  primary
caregiver for their mother. When their mother had health issues in 2022, Applicant sent
his older sister approximately $2,300 USD to pay for their mother’s medical expenses;
he  also  sent  this  sister  approximately  $500  USD  to  help  her  as  she  cared  for  their
mother. In 2023, Applicant sent this sister approximately $1,025 USD so that she could
hire a part-time caretaker for their mother. He intends to continue to financially assist his
sister  as  necessary  in  the  future.  Applicant  maintains  in-person,  telephonic,  and
electronic contact with his brother and sisters. He sees his brother approximately once
every four to five years, when they visit their mother in China. He last saw his siblings in
China in 2019, when he traveled there to visit their mother. He talks by chat room to his
older sister once every two to three months, and to his brother and younger sister once
or  twice  a  year.  Applicant’s  siblings  are  aware  that  he  underwent  a  background
investigation. (Tr. at 44-59, 61, 69-70, 90-91, 104-107; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, K, L, M)
During  his November 2018  background  interview, Applicant indicated  that he  has
contact with  a  high  school friend  in China.  Applicant  reaches out  to  this  friend  when  he
is  in   China   visiting   family.  Applicant   stated   in  his  October   2021   response   to
interrogatories that  when  he  saw this  friend  in  2014, the  friend  told  him  he  was a  “self-
employee and teach  a middle and high  school  Math one  to  one by  private.”  (GE  2)
Applicant traveled to China to visit his family in approximately 2009, 2011, 2012,
2014, 2017, and 2019. He also went to China in 2011 because his father passed away.
He  traveled  to  China  on  his  own  in  2011,  2012,  2014,  and  2019,  and  he  traveled  to
China with his spouse and child in 2017. He intends to continue to travel to China in the
future to visit his family there. He does not own property or have any bank accounts in
China. He estimated that the value of his home in the United States was $850,000, and
his  remaining  assets  in  the  United  States  were  $290,000.  Applicant  stated  in  his SCA
and indicated during his background interview that none of his family, or his high-school
friend,  are  affiliated  with  the  Chinese  government  or  military,  and  that  none  of  his
foreign contacts are aware that he is under consideration for a national security position.
Since approximately 2017, he donates to a nonprofit organization dedicated to exposing
the  evils  of  the  authoritarian  Chinese  Communist  Party  government  and  supporting
those seeking  freedom and human rights for China.  He stated,  “[The  United States] is
my  home.  This  is  where  I  belong.  I  will  never  ever  favor  China  over  the  country  that
[has] given me the chance to survive in freedom.” (Tr. at 64-65, 70-73, 88-90, 101-104,

In  October  2015,  Applicant’s  then-employer,  for  whom  he  had  been  working
since  2009,  terminated  him  from  employment  for  a  serious  violation  of  a  company
resource  directive,  after  he  inserted  a  personal  USB  hard  disk  containing  extensive
adult pornography into his work-issued computer in approximately August 2015. (SOR ¶
1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) As a result of Applicant’s action, his then-employer received an alarm
that  child  pornography  had  been  accessed.  (SOR  ¶  1.b,  1.b,  2.a,  3.a)  After  his  then-
employer  turned  the  matter  over  to  the  authorities,  the  county  sheriff’s  office
investigated   Applicant,  executed   a   search   warrant  at   his  residence   for   the   offense   of
child  pornography,  and  seized  numerous items of electronic and  digital media. He  was
not  arrested.  A  December   2016   letter  from   the   state’s  attorney   states,   “Forensic
analysis  of  the   items  seized   from   his  home   revealed   images   of   evidentiary  value.”   It
further  reflects  that  the   state   informed   Applicant  that  it   was  “willing   to   forego   a
prosecution   if   Applicant  forfeited   any  claim,  rights,   and   possessory  interest   in  the
offending  items.”  Applicant  was never charged  with  a  crime.  (Tr. at  73-88,  95-100,  108-
111, 113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant  denied   ever   viewing   child   pornography.  He   also   denied   accessing
illegal content on  his company computer. He  admitted  to  viewing  adult  pornography on
his  personal  computer  beginning   in  1995,  when   he   was  living   in  the   United   States
without  his then-spouse, and  he  saved  a  personal collection  of  it  onto  his personal USB
hard   disc.  He   stopped   viewing   and   downloading   adult  pornography  in  2000,  after  his
then-spouse  moved  to  the  United   States, and  he  had  not  accessed  his  USB  hard disc
containing   such   content  since   that   time.   In   2015,  when   he   used   his  USB   hard   disc   to
back  up   files  from   his  company  computer,   due   to   issues  with   company  laptops  dying,
software   crashing,  and   the   company’s   failure  to   provide   employees   with   storage
devices,   he   forgot  that  he   had   adult  pornography  on   his  USB   hard  disc.  He
acknowledged   that  he   should  have   used   an   empty  USB,  and   he   was  aware   of  the
company  policy  against   viewing   pornography  on   his work computer.  (Tr.  at  73-88,  95-

Applicant had no previous  unfavorable incidents  with this employer, and he has
not  had  any  unfavorable  incidents  since,  to  include  with  his  current  employer.  He
expressed  remorse  for  his  actions  and  stated  that  he  learned  his  lesson  not  to  use  a
personal  device  on  his  company  computer  and  to  follow  company  policies.  He  also
stated  that  he  timely  completes  annual  training  with  his  employer,  and  he  follows  his
employer’s  policies  and  procedures.  (Tr.  at 73-88, 95-100,  108-111,  113-114;  GE  1-3;

Applicant’s  manager,  and  coworker  since  2018,  described  Applicant  in  her
January 2022 letter, as a dedicated employee and  asset. A coworker of approximately
seven  years  also  described  him  as  a  hard-working  and  dedicated  employee.  Three
former  coworkers,  who  are  also  close  friends  of  Applicant,  attested  to  his  reliability,
trustworthiness,  and  work  ethic.  Applicant’s  spouse,  and  his  adult  child,  attested  to
Applicant’s  character,  describing  him  as  honest,  trustworthy,  personable,  and  a  good
family man. He received favorable performance evaluations from his employer in 2020
and 2021. (Tr. at 115-132; AE G, R-S, U-Y, CC, DD)
China
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  is  the
paramount  authority.  Communist  Party  members  hold  almost  all  top  government  and
security apparatus positions.
China has rapidly become more assertive, and it is the only competitor potentially
capable  of  combining  its  economic,  diplomatic,  military,  and  technological  power  to
mount  a  sustained  challenge  to  a  stable  and  open  international  system.  It  will  remain
the  top  threat  to  U.S.  technological  competitiveness  as  its  government  targets  key
sectors and proprietary commercial and military technology from the United States and
allied  companies  and  institutions.  It  uses  a  variety  of  tools,  from  public  investment  to
espionage, to advance its technological capabilities.
China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017 forms the baseline of the modern data
collection  regime,  and  compels  all  Chinese  firms  and  entities  to  support,  assist,  and
cooperate  with  Chinese  intelligence  services,  creating  a  legal  obligation  for  those
entities to turn over data collected abroad and domestically. It has expansive efforts in
place  to  acquire  U.S.  technology,  to  include  sensitive  trade  secrets  and  proprietary
information.
China’s  intelligence  services,  as  well  as  private  companies  and  other  entities,
frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can
use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media
devices or email. Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry that have
been  detected  are  focused  on  cleared  defense  contractors  or  information  technology
and  communications  firms  whose  products  and  services  support  government  and
private sector networks worldwide.
Multiple  U.S.  criminal  indictments  since  2015  involve  Chinese  nationals,
naturalized  U.S.  citizens  or  permanent  resident  aliens  from  China,  and  U.S.  citizens,
procuring  and  exporting  controlled  items  to China.  China’s  efforts to  acquire  sensitive,
dual-use,  or  military-grade  equipment  included  radiation  hardened  integrated  circuits,
monolithic microwave integrated circuits, accelerometers, gyroscopes, naval and marine
technologies,  syntactic
trade  secrets,  space  communications,  military
jamming  equipment,  dynamic  random-access  memory,  aviation
communication
technologies,  and  anti-submarine  warfare  technologies.  About  80%  of  all  economic
espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice allege conduct that
would  benefit  the  Chinese  state,  and  there  is  at  least  some  nexus  to  China  in  around
60% of all trade secret theft cases.

The  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that  in  2021,  significant  human  rights
issues  in  China  included:  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings,  forced  disappearances,  torture,
and  arbitrary  detention  by  the  Chinese  government;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
and  detention  conditions;  political  prisoners;  politically  motivated  reprisal  against
individuals  outside  the  country;  the  lack  of  an  independent  judiciary  and  Communist
Party  control  over  the  judicial  and  legal  system;  arbitrary  interference  with  privacy,
including  pervasive  and  intrusive  technical  surveillance  and  monitoring;  punishment  of
family  members  for  offenses  allegedly  committed  by  an  individual;  serious  restrictions
on free expression, the press, and the internet; serious restrictions on internet freedom;
substantial  interference  with  the  freedom  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of
association;  severe  restrictions  and  suppression  of  religious  freedom;  substantial
restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refoulement  of  asylum  seekers  to  North  Korea;
the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  peacefully  through  free  and  fair
elections;  serious  restrictions  on  political  participation;  serious  acts  of  government
corruption;  forced  sterilization  and  coerced  abortions;  trafficking  in  persons;  severe
restrictions on labor rights; and child labor. Since the imposition of the National Security
Law  on  June  30,  2020,  China  unilaterally  and  arbitrarily  exercises  police  and  security
power in Hong Kong.
In  2019,  China’s  response  to  terrorism  remained  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the
government’s  suppression  of  peaceful  activities  that  authorities  deemed  separatist  or
subversive in nature. Details about alleged terrorism-related incidents inside China were
difficulty  to  verify  due  to  a  lack  of  transparency  and  information  from  Chinese
authorities.  As  in  2018,  Chinese  officials  continued  to  claim  that  no  violent  terrorist
incidents  have  occurred  in  the  country  since  2016,  owing  to  the  government’s  “new
counter-extremism policies,” to justify Beijing’s repressive campaign in Xinjiang.
The  U.S. Department of  State  in  April 2022  rated  China  as Level 3: Reconsider
Travel to  China  and  Hong  Kong, due  to  arbitrary enforcement of local laws and  COVID-
19  related  restrictions, and  it ordered  the  departure  of non-emergency U.S. Government
employees   and   all   family  members  from   the   Consulate   General  Shanghai  consular

"Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since June 2022. He attended college for a period, but he has not
earned a degree. He is twice divorced. His first marriage ended in 2010 and his second
in 2020. He has two children, ages 24 and 18. (Tr. at 28-30, 34-35, 49-50; GE 1)
Applicant  worked for a defense  contractor from 2014  until  he  was terminated  in
November  2019.  His  company  provided  him  with  a  smart  phone  and  a  computer.  He
was permitted to use both for personal reasons, but he was not permitted to use them
for inappropriate  purposes,  including  viewing  and  downloading pornography.  Applicant
viewed pornography at his home  on the work laptop from about October to November
2019.  He  was  terminated  when  it  was  discovered.  (Tr.  at  28-30,  52-55;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant is remorseful for the conduct. He stated that it was his way of dealing
with a stressful divorce. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson,
and  the  conduct  will  not  be  repeated.  His  current  employer  is  unaware  that  he  was
terminated  from  a  previous  job  for  viewing  pornography  on  his  work  computer.  (Tr.  at

The   SOR  alleges   three   delinquent  debts  totaling   about  $48,670   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a-
1.c),  a   delinquent  $212   utility   bill  (SOR  ¶   1.d),  and   a   child   support  account  that   was
$2,781  past due  with  a  $3,022  balance  (SOR ¶  1.e).  Applicant admitted  owing  the  three
large  debts.  He  denied  owing  the  utility  debt. He admitted  owing  back  child  support, but
he  stated   that  he   was   making   payments.   (Tr.  at  39-44;  Applicant’s  response   to   SOR;

Applicant attributed  his  financial problems to  his  divorce  and unemployment  after
his  termination.  The   COVID-19   pandemic  hindered   his  efforts  to   find   another  job.  He
remained  unemployed  from   about November  2019  to  May  2021.  (Tr. at 28-32, 34,  36-

Applicant  did  not  discover  he  was  the  father  of  his  younger  child  until  she  was
about 11 years old. When the court awarded child support, it awarded about $46,000 in
arrearages.  Applicant paid about  $26,000  toward  the arrearages  from his  share  of the
equity in the family home, which was sold as part of the division of assets in his divorce.
His pay is being garnished for the child support and arrearages (SOR ¶ 1.e). Now that
his daughter  is  18, the  garnishment  will go completely to  the  arrearages. The balance
has been reduced from $3,053 on the January 2022 credit report, to $3,022 on the June
2022 credit report, to $1,492 on the July 2023 credit report. (Tr. at 30-31, 44-48; GE 1-6
Applicant denied owing the $212 utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.d). He stated that he never
had an account with that utility company. It is listed on all the credit reports in evidence.
(Tr. at 44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6)
Applicant has not made  any payments toward  the  three  large  debts. He planned
to   use   the   money  from   the   sale   of  the   marital   home   to   pay   his   debts,  but  that   money
went to  his child  support arrearages. He contacted  the  creditors in 2022  about  settling
the  debts, but his efforts were  unsuccessful. His finances  appear to  be  otherwise stable.
With  his  child  support  ending  in  the  near future, he  can  use  those  funds  toward paying
his delinquent debts.  He has not received  formal financial counseling. (Tr. at 31, 40, 49-

On  January  13,  2021,  a  U.S.  servicemember  reported  that  a  vehicle  on  the
military  installation  was  “displaying  Three  Percenter  and  QAnon  stickers  on  its  back
window.  Both  of  these  organizations/beliefs  have  been  linked  to  racially  motivated
violent  extremism  and  anti-government  actions.”  He  reported  that  he  first  noticed  the
“III” sticker on July 31, 2020, and the QAnon sticker on January 12, 2021. He stated that
he became aware of the III symbol because it was reported that an NFL player had the
symbol as a tattoo.1 (GE 3, 4 at 38-39)
The  military  criminal  investigation  division  did  a  criminal  and  insider-threat
analysis  and  determined  that  Applicant  was  not  suspected  of  committing  a  criminal
offense  or  being  an  insider  threat.  The  military  criminal  investigation  division  did  not
open an investigation, with the following rationale in an email dated January 15, 2021:
1. Social media was identified with no derogatory information noted.
2.  The   FBI   has   not   designated   the   3%ers  or  QAnon   as  a   terrorist
organization. Neither of them  are organized groups.
3.  The   3%er  sticker  alone   is  not  an   indicator  of  militia   affiliation   (see
attached   [FBI  Joint  Information   Bulletin   identified   in   above   Evidence
section] and below for more details.
4. While an  internet search for  three  percenters  (III%) and  QAnon  will  yield
several sites declaring  them  anti-government, militia  linked, or conspiracy
theorists;  as  with   any   group   there  are  those   who   take   matters  to   the
extreme  and  those  who  are more conservative  in their  voice. Displaying  a
sticker in support of  either group does not make an individual a  threat.
5.  At  this  time,  [Applicant]  is  not  suspected  of  committing  a  criminal
offense or insider threat. (GE 4 at 133)
An  administrative  investigation  was  ordered  and  completed  by  a  U.S.  military
field  grade  officer.  The  investigation  disclosed  that  the  vehicle  belonged  to  Applicant.
The  Three  Percenter  sticker  has  III  inside  a  circle  of  stars.  The  QAnon  sticker  is  a
stylized Q with a skull inside. Applicant bought the III sticker on eBay for $20 and placed
it on his vehicle in about June 2020. He bought the QAnon sticker on eBay for $10 and
placed it on his vehicle in about January 2021. He also bought a rubber bracelet with a
red Q. (Tr. at 66, 94-102, 110-111; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
During  the  investigation,  Applicant  stated  that  he  placed  the  III  sticker  on  his
vehicle because he liked the design and to “tell that I defend the Constitution. That I am
a  patriot.  I  want  to  show  loyalty  as  a  patriotic  American.”  He  stated  that  his
understanding  of  the  Three  Percenters  was  that  “[i]t’s  like  Paul  Revere,  protecting  the

the
second amendment and the Constitution. Nothing to do with supremacy or extremism.”
(GE 3, 4)
Applicant  stated  that  he  placed  the  QAnon  sticker  on  his  vehicle  “to  raise
awareness. Spawn curious[ity] and let people research for themselves.”  He stated that
his understanding of QAnon was that it “is a group that conducts independent research.
It’s  not  an  ideology  nor  does  it  promote  violence  or  any  type  of  derogatory  actions.
[T]here  is  no  ill  har[m]  at  all.  It  is  suspected  of  being  very  close  to  [the]  Trump
administration.” (GE 3, 4 at 68-71)
The  investigator  interviewed  a  number  of  Applicant’s  work  colleagues.  He  was
described as “glad to be at work”; “low-key, calm, friendly, easy going guy”; “respectful
and  competent  in  his  duties”;  “very  quiet,  tends  to  keep  things  to  himself”;  and  an
“introvert.”  Most  of  his  colleagues  stated  that  they  had  not  seen  Applicant  display
images of either QAnon or Three Percenters, but most of his colleagues were unfamiliar
with QAnon or Three Percenters before the investigation. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant’s  supervisor  at  the  time,  a  retired  lieutenant  colonel,  provided  a
statement for the investigation. He had never heard Applicant discuss Three Percenters
or QAnon, and he never heard Applicant advocate any activities designed to overthrow
the  U.S.  Government  by  force.  He  stated  that  “[e]verybody  in  the  office  discussed  the
riots  on  Jan.  6.  We  were  all  horrified  by  the  incident  and  everyone  in  the  office
disagreed with what occurred, including [Applicant].” The supervisor was unfamiliar with
Three Percenters before Applicant’s stickers became an issue. He then looked them up
online. What he found indicated that the Three Percenters supported the Constitution by
non-violent means. He also looked up QAnon, and he felt  it was developed as a joke,
and  that  “[w]ho  else  would  come  up  with  a  story  line  that  the  world  is  controlled  by  a
small  cabal  of  children  eating  cannibals?  A  good  video  game  story,  but,  laughable.  I
don’t think anyone takes it seriously, but they enjoy following the antics of the few idiots
who do.” (GE 4 at 44)
One  employee  reported  to  the  investigator  that  he  and Applicant were  traveling
by  car  on  a  work  trip  when  he  noticed  Applicant  wearing  a  rubber  bracelet  with  a  red
letter Q. The employee asked him about the bracelet. Applicant stated it was an online
social media group that he followed. The employee reported that Applicant “described Q
as  what  [he]  would  consider  conspiracy  theories  about  shadow  government  and
pedophiles.” (Tr. at 77-79, 109; GE 4 at 91; AE L)
The  investigator  reported  that  there  was  no  indication  that  Applicant  had  ever
specifically  advocated  activities  designed  to  overthrow  the  U.S.  Government  by  force,
and that there was no indication that he supported the January 6, 2021 insurrection at
the Capitol. (GE 3, 4)
On  numerous  occasions,  Applicant  accessed  QAnon-affiliated  websites  and
social media using his government computer system. On June 29, 2020, and June 30,
2020,  using  his  government  email  account,  he  sent  emails  through  his  government
computer  system  to  three  other  federal  employees.  Attached  to  the  emails  were
documents  that  contained  QAnon-associated  rhetoric.  With  slight  variations,  the  two
attached  documents  had  the  same  message.  The  two-page  message  is  a  rambling
diatribe  that  appears  to  be  mainly  against  the  mainstream  media  with  open-ended
questions.  This  was  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  around  the  time  of  the
lockdown.  One  of  the  recipients  of  the  email  stated  that  he  was  not  alarmed  by  the
message  and  thought  the  message  may  have  referred  to  the  media’s  coverage  of
elections and the lockdown. Another recipient remembered receiving the email, but not
the  contents.  (Tr.  at  74-75,  84-85,  106-108;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  3,  4  at
100-119)
I did not understand much of the QAnon message (possibly because it is written
in a way to be intentionally obtuse), but I did not see anything calling for violence. One
section  stated,  “They  want  you  divided”  by  religion,  race,  sex,  political  affiliation,  and
class,  and  that  “When  you  are  divided,  and  angry,  and  controlled,  you  target  those
‘different’  from  you,  not  those  responsible  [controllers].”  (Emphasis  in  original)  The
message closed with:
“Free   thought”   is  a   philosophical   viewpoint   which   holds  that  positions
regarding   truth   should  be   formed   on  the   basis  of  logic,  reason,  and
empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma.
THIS   REPRESENTS   A   CLEAR   AND   PRESENT   DANGER  TO  THE
CONSTITUTIONAL  REPUBLIC  OF  THE  UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.
(GE 4 at 113-119)
Applicant  followed   on   his  government   computer  system   numerous   QAnon
conspiracy  theories  and   messages  posted   on   Facebook.  A   post   from   May  7,  2020,
addressed  a  media conspiracy  directed  at the  2020  Presidential election, and  included:
“When  do  you  expend  ammunition?  For What  Purpose?  .  . . You  have  more power and
influence   than   you   realize.   Welcome   to   the   Revolution.  Q”  (Emphasis  in   original)
Another   post   on   October  31,  2020,  stated,  “Are  you   ready  to   finish   what  we   started?
‘Nothing  can  stop  what  is coming’ is not  just  a  catch-phrase.  Q”  A  third  post,  apparently
from November 2020, was a  political comic referencing  election fraud. (GE   3,  4)
Applicant  removed  the  bumper  stickers  in  January  2020,  after  emails  about
extremist  iconography  were  circulated  through  the  command.  (Tr.  at  69-70,  102-106;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant’s access to classified information was suspended in March 2021. (GE
8,  9)  In  April  2021,  the  commander  of  the  U.S.  forces  in  Country  A  barred  Applicant
from entering any U.S. military installation in the country for ten years, with the following
rationale:
You   have   been   found   to   have   displayed   iconography   associated   with
extremist  ideologies  on   your  personally  owned   vehicle   and   in  the
workplace. Additionally, you  distributed  material associated  with  extremist
ideologies.   Your  actions   are  incompatible  with   the   interests   of  national
security,   reflect  negatively  on   the   image   of  the   U.S.   overseas,  and
adversely  affect  the   safety  and   morale   of  personnel  on   [U.S.   facilities  in
Country A].  (GE 6)
When  Applicant  was  barred  from  the  military  installations,  he  also  lost  his  job,
and he had to relocate back to the United States. He could not afford to move much of
his household goods, and he gave most  things  away.  He estimated  that he lost about
$100,000 through the process. (Tr. at 65, 88-82; GE 1, 2, 8)
Applicant adamantly denied that he is a Three Percenter, that he has ever been
a member of a militia or any similar group, or that he supports or is sympathetic to any
group  that  “advocates resistance  to  certain U.S.  federal government  policies.”  He  was
horrified  by  the  events  at  the  Capitol  on  January  6,  2021.  He  testified  that  he  did  not
understand  the full meaning of  the  III sticker, and that he came across  it on  eBay. He
liked  the  design,  and  he  thought  it  symbolized  patriotism,  support  for  the  Second
Amendment,  and  the  national  dialogue.  He  did  not  realize  it  was  associated  with
extremist groups. He added that he “thought they were Constitution defenders, kind of
like Paul Revere, people that stand up when there is like, the Government is not doing
exactly  as  the  Constitution  states.”  (Tr.  at  66-68,  82-83,  94-97,  113-122;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  he  thought  “QAnon  is  basically  an  online  repository  of
information.  There’s  no  ideology.  A  person  can  go  in  and  access  it  and  do  their  own
research  on  it.”  He  stated  that  it  is  “kind  of like  a  big  puzzle,”  and “kind  of  like  the  Da
Vinci  Code.”  He  did  not  agree  with  everything  on  QAnon.  He  stated  that  he  sent  the
emails  “to  spawn  curiosity,  just  to  give  them  an  alternate  view  over  what  mainstream
media was saying on the TV in our office.” He stated that he thought the QAnon website
he  visited  would  have been  blocked if  it  was  a  problem, and he was  never notified by
any  IT  personnel  that  it  was  a  problem  before  the  investigation.  He  felt  the  QAnon
message  he  sent  was  anti-racist,  and  promoted  unification,  not  division.  He  now  feels
that  he  was  misinformed  about  QAnon.  He  does  not  intend  to  have  any  further
connection  to  QAnon.  (Tr.  at  71-77,  84-87,  97-102,  110-117,  122-132;  Applicant’s
response to SOR)
Applicant  submitted  letters  and  documents  attesting  to  his  outstanding  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  patriotism,  efficiency,
competence, dedication, work ethic, compassion, leadership, positive attitude, honesty,
trustworthiness,  and  loyalty  to  the  United  States.  They  recommend  him  for  a  security
clearance. (AE D, J)
The   colleagues  and   supervisor   at   his  former  job,   which   include   several  retired
U.S.   military  officers,   feel  that  Applicant  was   unfairly  treated   because   they  never  saw
any  indication   that  he   was   sympathetic   to   any  militia   or  extremist  group.   They   confirm
that  he   was  appalled   by  the   events  of  January   6,  2021,  and   he   condemned   the
insurrection.  They   believe   that   the   politically  charged   atmosphere  following   January  6,
2021,  contributed   to   the   command’s   decisions.   A   security  officer  at  the   command
expressed   the   same   view.  One   co-worker  wrote   in  his  statement  for  the   investigation,
“[Applicant]  has never represented  himself as  anything  other than  being  patriotic.  I  think
he got himself caught up in something he didn’t know what he was getting into.” (Tr. at

"Having   thoroughly  considered   the   evidence   in  the   record,  I  make   the   following
findings  of  fact:   Applicant  is  51   years  old.  He   enlisted   in  the   Marine   Corps  in  August
1990.  He served  in  Desert Storm,  Desert Shield, Operation  Restore Hope,  31st  Marine
Expeditionary Unit (MEU) out of Okinawa, Japan, and  on  two  sea  service  deployments
throughout  Southwest   Asia.   He  earned  a   master’s  degree   in  2007   from   the   Naval
Postgraduate   School  in   information   technology  management  (ITM).  He  retired   with   an
honorable  discharge  in  July  2011  at the  rank of  staff  sergeant. His decorations  include
the   Meritorious   Service  Medal,  Navy   Commendation   Medal,   and
three   Navy
Achievement Medals. He has an  extensive  background  in IT and  various certifications.
Applicant  was   married   in  1994   and   subsequently   divorced   in   2018.  He   has  an   adult
daughter, and a  son, age 17.  (Tr. 12-13, 23-25; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  was  hired  in  February  2014  by  a  government  contractor  as  an
operations  manager.  One  of  his  responsibilities  was  to  ensure  that  the  company’s  IT
operations  ran  smoothly.  He  held  a  DOD  security  clearance  in  this  position.  Under
Guideline  M  (Use  of  Information  Technology),  SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant,  while
employed  in  this  position  and  without  the  chief  executive  officer’s  (CEO)  approval,
obtained and utilized access to his employer’s network drives, which contained the co-
owners’ personal information, as well as corporate sensitive information. (Tr. 23, 25-29;
GE 4)
Applicant testified at the hearing that he  had asked the co-owner  (minority owner)
of the company  for  system  administrator access  through  an  email  communication, with
the  CEO  copied  on  the  email. In about June  2014, he  was granted  system  administrator
access   in  order to   perform   a   network  assessment.   He admitted  that  with   administrator
access   he   had   admittance   to   the   owners’   personal   information   and   any   company
proprietary  information  that was  saved  on  any of the  drives  on  the  network.  He  denied
this  allegation   in  his  SOR  Answer  because   he   did  not  use   or  take   any  proprietary  or
sensitive information.  Applicant  also adamantly  denied  in his SOR  Answer ever having
system  administrator access, which  would  have  prevented  him  from  doing  some  of the
activities  alleged  in the  SOR.  This information  contradicts his testimony.  (Tr. 30-31, 51-
52)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant, without being tasked to do so, gave an outside
vendor and personal friend/acquaintance, access to his employer’s network and allowed
the  vendor  to  install hardware/software  devices  on  the  network  without  prior  approval.
He did not obtain a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) from the vendor before giving the
vendor access to sensitive company data.
In  June  2014,  Applicant  hired  vendor  (A  to  come  to  the  business  where  the
vender  installed  software  and  hardware  (Infoblox)  to  access  the  network  to  ensure
cyber compliance and to perform network hardening, or the testing of vulnerabilities on
the  company’s hard  drives.  Applicant  was familiar  with  the person who  worked for the
software  company,  but  not  the  vendor  who  used  the  software.  After  the  vendor
performed  these  services,  Applicant  admitted  the  CEO  claimed  that  he  had  not  been
given  authorization  to  have  a  vendor  perform  specific  tasks  during  the  network
assessment. He stated that he had been clear during weekly work meetings of his intent
to hire vendor A to access the company’s network. He was present with the vendor the
entire  time  they  were  on  location  performing  these  tasks.  The  vendor  tested  for
vulnerabilities across the network and provided recommendations on how to harden the
network.  He  was  not  aware  that  he  was  supposed  to  obtain  an  NDA  from  the  vendor
since he thought NDAs were only needed in business development. Applicant admitted
he  used  the  system  administrator  status  he  was  granted  so  the  vendor  could  perform
these tests. He testified that he held the system administrator rights for about two weeks
in June 2014. (Tr. 32-36, 50-52; GE 4)
A  government  witness,  Mr.  Z,  with  31  years  of  IT  experience  and  who  also
provided IT services to the federal contractor through his company, testified that a few
weeks before Applicant resigned from his employment, Mr. Z was tasked with reviewing
and  monitoring  the  government  contractor’s  network  to  determine  if  any  company
documents were lost or if any data was transferred from the company’s network. Mr. Z
testified  that  he  managed  all  the  rights,  permissions,  and  access  to  data  on  the
company’s network. He did not grant system administrator privileges to Applicant, but in
May 2014, he did grant vendor A full access through a temporary system administrator
account. Applicant was also able to have system administrator access via the temporary
account  that  was  to  be  used  only  by  the  vendor.  He  stated  that  Applicant  used  the
temporary  account  access  privileges  from  May  2014  until  late  September  2014,  when
an  employee  reported  that  Applicant  had  complete  domain  administrator  privileges
because Applicant had given him the account access password. Mr. Z testified that the
security manager immediately requested that he remove Applicant’s access through the
temporary account created for the vendor. (Tr. 18, 97-99, 101-103, 105-107; GE 2, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  on  January  14,  2015,  Applicant  downloaded  his
information  regarding  the
employer’s  proprietary
employer’s owners, and project data related to one or more government contracts.  He
saved approximately 7 GB of data to a personal Dropbox and then deleted evidence of
the activity from his work laptop.
information,  sensitive  personal
Applicant testified this event occurred about a month before he left this place of
employment.  He  stated  that  he  installed  a  Dropbox  account  due  to  employees  having
difficulty  obtaining  information  from  the  company  drives.  This  Dropbox  allowed  project
employees  access  to  information  while  there  were  at  their  customer  worksites.  The
information he placed in the Dropbox was necessary for the employees to perform their
job duties, and he said the Dropbox was in full compliance with IT rules and regulations.
He did not recall asking for permission to set up the Dropbox account but stated he had
provided  notice  during  the  weekly  meetings  that  he  was  going  to  do  so.  He  started
moving data  into the Dropbox, which he claimed was  a  secure environment, using  his
work e-mail. He worked out of the conference room on a regular basis and sometimes
turned off the lights to take advantage of the natural lighting. As soon as the CEO found
out  that  he  had  completed  this  task,  she  got  extremely  upset,  and  he  immediately
deleted the information he had placed into the Dropbox. (Tr. 36-45, 62-64; GE 2)
Mr. Z testified that the night of January 14, 2015, just before Applicant departed
from  his  employment,  he  was  accessing  files  from  the  company’s  server  at  4:20  p.m.
The forensic evidence showed that about 7 GB of data was transferred onto Applicant’s
laptop in his Dropbox account. Mr. Z stated that the Dropbox was not a secure or proper
way  to  handle  the  transference  of  sensitive  information.  The  office  video  camera
footage showed that at 6:26 p.m., Applicant turned off the lights in the conference room
while  waiting  for  the  data  to  migrate.  At  7:04  p.m.,  Applicant  deleted  the  Dropbox
content from his laptop with encryption to prevent detection. Security video footage also
showed that Applicant then turned on the lights, activated the building’s security alarm,
and  exited  the  building  with  his  personal  belongings  in  hand.  Based  on  the  forensic
evidence found by Mr. Z during an examination of Applicant’s work laptop, the CEO filed
an  incident  report  against  Applicant.  She  accused  Applicant  of  downloading  company
proprietary information and sensitive personal information concerning the owners of the
company,  and  project  data  related  to  one  or  more  government  contracts  that  was
possibly considered Controlled Technical Information. On this day, Applicant moved the
data into a personal Dropbox account on his work laptop using his personal email, and
then he deleted the trail from his laptop that same evening with the use of File Sanitizer,
which  was  used  to  permanently  delete  files.  Less  than  a  week  after  this  incident,
Applicant  submitted  his  letter  of  resignation  to  the  company.  The  detailed  analysis  of
forensic  data  recovered  from  Applicant’s  laptop  was  provided  to  the  Defense  Security
Service and the FBI. (Tr. 107-112; GE 2, 3, 4)
Due  to  this  incident,  in  April  2015,  the  security  manager  of  the  government
contractor  contacted  their  customer  on  a  government  contract  to  self-report  a  security
incident  concerning  their  former  employee.  The  security  manager  informed  their
customer  that  Applicant  had  downloaded  sensitive  information  regarding  the  contract,
and requested further direction from the customer. (GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  violated  his  employer’s  IT  policies  when  he
used  his  work  laptop  to  download  or  access  pornographic  material.  Applicant  testified
that  he  was  not  aware  that  he  had  accessed  pornography  on  his  work  laptop,  but  he
takes  accountability  for  this  transgression.  “I'm  not  saying  I  didn't  do  it.  I'm  just  not
aware  of  it.”  He  testified  that  he  would  never  download  porn  but  he  could  have
accessed porn on his work laptop. He was aware that he should generally not access
pornography on a work laptop, but he was not aware of any specific rule or policy that
prohibited  such  conduct.  He  was  not  aware  that  porn  sites  were  notorious  for  having
viruses or malware. (Tr. 46, 77-78; GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  “enabled”  or  tampered  with  “HP  Protect”
security  software on his laptop  in  violation of company policy. Applicant  stated that he
did use HP Protect to wipe the work computer when he was departing his employment
in February 2015, which he thought was an acceptable practice at most companies. He
denied installing HP Protect on his work computer because he believed it was already
preloaded  onto  his  work  computer.  He  did  not  admit  to  wiping  his  computer  clean  on
more than one occasion, but he did admit he did so at the end of his employment. (Tr.
36-45, 47-49; 62-64; GE 2, 4)
Mr. Z testified that wiping a computer clean is a red flag for IT professionals that
someone  is  trying  to  hide  something  on  their  computer.  Wiping  a  computer  before
departing a place of employment is also not a common practice within the industry. He
testified that a standard user should not have access to do a factory reset of the work
computer  unless  they  had  administrator  rights.  When  a  laptop  is  returned  by  an
employee, all that is needed is to wipe out the user’s profile. There is no need to initiate
a  complete  wipe  of  the  computer.  Mr.  Z said  that  Applicant  had  completed  a  previous
wipe  to  his  work  laptop  in  either  July  or  August  2014,  in  addition  to  the  wipe  he
performed in February 2015, based on his forensic analysis. Mr. Z was able to recover
most of the deleted data on Applicant’s laptop by using R-Studio, and other applications
in  his  forensic  examination.  He  determined  that  Applicant  had  been  able  to  do  many
activities that a standard IT user would not be able to do. (Tr. 108-117; GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  Applicant  created  multiple  usernames  and  passwords
without  IT  or  CEO  permission  in  violation  of  company  policy.  Applicant  stated  this
incident  stemmed  from  the  time  he  hired  a  vendor  to  perform  system  checks  and
vulnerabilities  on  the  company’s  network.  He  created  multiple  usernames  and
passwords  so  that  the  system  screenings  could  be  performed.  Another  employee
reported  to the  security  manager  in  September 2014  that Applicant  had  given  him  the
system administration password. The security manager contacted Mr. Z and requested
that Applicant’s system administrator access be removed immediately. When Applicant
was questioned about this incident, he stated; “I don’t really understand the context, so
it’s hard for me to say.” (Tr. 50-52; GE 4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant installed unauthorized software on his company
laptop  in  violation  of  company  policy.  Department  Counsel  acknowledged  this  SOR
allegation  somewhat  overlapped  with  the  allegation  of  Applicant  installing  or using  HP
Protect  software.  Applicant  stated  in  his  SOR  response  “I  did  not  utilize,  nor  was  I
afforded  system  administration  or  network  administration  right  in  any  capacity  of  my
job.”  This  sentiment  is  repeated  several  times  in  his  SOR  Answer.  His  testimony
indicated  he  was granted  system  administrator  privileges for approximately two  weeks
in June  2014  by  the  minority owner.  Applicant explained  previously that  the  HP Protect
software   was  already   preloaded   on   his  work  computer,  but  the   IT  provider,  Mr.  Z,
testified   that  he   deleted   all   applications  of   HP  Protect  from   all   of  the   work  laptops
provided  to  government contractor employees. When  I specifically asked  Applicant if  he
had  downloaded  HP Protect,  which  was used  to  wipe  his laptop,  his response  was;  “No,
not  that  I'm   aware   of.”   He  denied   knowledge   of   the   File  Shredder   on  his  laptop,  and
explained   that  the  Dropbox account  was   not   software   but  was  actually   “a   link  to   go   to
the  internet”  in  order to  interface  with  an  encrypted  site, like  a  cloud.  (Tr. 47,  52-54, 56-
57; SOR Answer; GE  4)
Mr.  Z testified  that the federal contractor did not utilize  Dropbox. He  stated  that
government contractors are not permitted to store any information on the cloud unless it
is  an  approved  government  cloud,  such  as  DOD  SAFE,  for  instance.  He  also  pointed
out that if an employee needed Dropbox, they would use their work email address and
create  the  account.  Applicant  did  not  use  his  work  email  address.  Applicant  used  his
personal account when using Dropbox on his computer. Mr. Z stated that the analysis of
the Dropbox  not only showed the  contractor’s  data  was stored there,  but also  showed
data Applicant had taken from a previous employer. Mr. Z stated, “so, we see a pattern
here.” (Tr. 117-122; GE 4)
SOR ¶  1.h  alleges that  Applicant disabled  or  failed  to  run  virus protection  on  his
work  laptop,  which   resulted   in  malware  virus  infestation   of  his  local  profile.   He  denied
this allegation  in  his Answer and  again during  his testimony.  When questioned  about  his
access  to  porn  websites to  view pornography, I asked  Applicant  whether it  was  common
knowledge   in  the   IT  industry  that  many  of  these   porn   websites  contained   viruses  or
malware.  Applicant  answered  that  he  was not aware  of this  information.  (Tr. 54-55, 77-
78; SOR Answer; GE  4)
Mr.  Z logged into Applicant’s  work laptop and  discovered  that  there  was  not  an
active  virus  defense  application  installed.  A  full  scan  of  the  computer  revealed  Trojan
viruses and malware in the local profile used by Applicant. Mr. Z had to have the viruses
and  malware  removed  before  a  detailed  analysis  of  Applicant’s  laptop  could  be
completed.  Mr.  Z  also  noted  that  accessing  pornographic  websites  could  have
contributed to the viruses and malware on the laptop. (GE 4)
Applicant departed employment with the federal contractor in February 2015 and
started  a  franchise.  He  testified  that  the  franchise  did  not  interfere  or  overlap  with  the
business of his former employer. He operated the franchise for five years while he also
worked concurrently as a sales director for another company. Since 2018, Applicant has
served as a vice president of his current company, and he is requesting a DOD security
clearance  be  granted  so  he  can  perform  specific  job  duties.  (GE  1;  Tr.  12-13,  22-23;

Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  alleged  Guideline  K  (Handling  Protected  information)
security  concerns,  and  it  cross-alleged  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c.  Applicant  denied  that  he
mishandled  protected  information  in  any  way.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  Paragraph  3  of  the  SOR
alleged Guideline E (Personal Conduct) security concerns, as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that in approximately August 2014, Applicant refused a direct
order  from  the  CEO  to  lay  off  an  employee.  Applicant  admitted  this  information  in  his
Answer. Instead of laying off the employee, he stated that the CEO wanted him to fire
the  female  employee  for  a  dress  code  violation,  specifically,  for  a  skirt  that  was  too
short.  Applicant  determined  that  this  employee  was  not  in  violation  of  company  policy
and  refused  to  fire  the  employee.  A  meeting  followed,  and  the  CEO  again  asked
Applicant to fire the employee. Applicant stated that he refused because the female was
not his employee and because he believed that both owners of the company were also
in  violation of  the  dress  code policy.  Applicant  denied that  he had a  close  relationship
with this employee, but he did acknowledge she was hired to work for his franchise after
he left the government contractor. The CEO reported that Applicant was asked to lay off
the employee due to lack of contract work, and he refused. (Tr. 64-69; GE 5)
SOR  ¶  3.b  alleges  that  in  approximately  August  2014,  Applicant  informed  the
company’s security officer that he already had possession of all of his employer’s data.
Applicant  denied  this  information.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  any  data  that  he
maintained was for the normal performance of his employment duties. He testified that
because  he  did  not  have  system  administrative  rights,  he  denied  that  he  had  “full”
access to all of the company’s data. (Tr. 69-70; GE 5)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges that while Applicant was the sole administer of his employer’s
LinkedIn account, he allowed, or caused, the employer’s page to be changed or redirect
visitors to Applicant’s new startup company, rather than the federal contractor. Applicant
admitted  setting  up  his  employer’s  LinkedIn  account.  After  his  departure,  he  was  not
aware  he  was  the  sole  person  who  retained  rights  to  the  LinkedIn  account.  Once  the
human  resources  director  contacted  him  about  this  matter,  he  immediately  provided
access  and  privileges  to  his  previous  employer.  His  testimony  was  that  this  was  a
misunderstanding and in no way intentional. (Tr. 70-72; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 3.d cross-alleged all of the information  cited  under Paragraphs 1  and 2.
Applicant denied this information.
Character Evidence
Applicant called a former colleague who had worked with him while employed by
the  same  government  contractor.  The  individual  said  he  felt  compelled  to  testify  on
behalf  of  Applicant  because  after  he  left  this  same  employer  in  early  2016,  the
company’s  CEO  also  falsely  charged  him  with  many  of  the  same  accusations  they
made about Applicant after his departure in February 2015. The witness believed these
were  company  tactics  to  prevent  employees  from  competing  with  the  company’s
business. He clarified that his role in this company was business development, and he
was  not  involved  in  IT.  He  also  admitted  that  he  continued  to  develop  business  after
leaving  this  employment,  and  the  federal  contractor  was  successful  in  preventing  him
from pursuing business with a contact he had developed. The witness also testified that
he has worked on many projects with Applicant, and Applicant’s business and personal
actions  were  always  beyond  reproach.  He  recommended  that  Applicant  be  granted  a
DOD security clearance. (Tr. 82-93; AE F, G)
Applicant  also  provided  character-reference  letters  from  a  previous  employee,
supervisor, and the president of the federal contractor that currently employs Applicant.
The  general  sense  of  the  character  evidence  is  that  he  is  diligent,  professional,
productive,  reliable,  and
important
contributions to warfighters’ mission. His character statements support reinstatement of
his security clearance. (AE C, D, E)

"In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations in the SOR.
His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a   37-year-old  male.  He  holds  a   Ph.D.   earned   in  2020   while  living

SOR ¶ 1.a: failed to file as required Federal income tax  returns for tax years
2013 through 2018. Applicant admits the allegation. As mitigation he offers that he was
living overseas in a country where he believed there was a treaty that income earned in
the one country would only be taxed by the country where he was residing but not both.
He notes the IRS had not reached out to him, so he concluded it was “likely” not an issue
for them. (Answer.) His Federal tax account transcripts for the tax years alleged reflect
no  tax  returns  filed  for  the  years  provided.  (Item  3.)  In  his  Response,  he  again
acknowledged not filing his tax returns for tax years 2013-2018 and attached the unfiled
1040 forms with calculations that indicated he owed no money. He stated had he thought
he owed money or had he been living in the United States he would have “definitely"" filed
his Federal returns. He offers as mitigation these incidents happened several years ago
while living and working on his Ph.D. overseas, and since returning to the United States,
he  has  started  working  with  a  tax  preparer  to  file  returns  for  the  missing  years.  In  his
Response, he notes as mitigation he filed his tax returns for tax years 2019 through 2022.

SOR ¶  2.a: Applicant illegally downloaded movies from his school computer
while  attending  the  University  (X),  from  about  2005  to  about  2006,  without
authorization and against school policy. Applicant admits the allegation. He clarified
in his Answer that he believes the downloading occurred on his personal computer. As
mitigation he highlights that sufficient time has passed; that he had very little income while
a student and could not afford to purchase the movies; and notes the last time he illegally
downloaded something  was in October 2022. (Answer at 2.)  He was reprimanded  by the
University  (X) for copyright violations in  December 2005. The  reprimand  advised  him  a
second  violation  would   result in   serious consequences,   which  “at a   minimum” included
being  charged  with  violation  of computer policy, theft  of intellectual property,  and  failure
to  comply with an official request.  (Item 4  at 7, 16.)
SOR  ¶   2.b:  Applicant  illegally  downloaded  television  shows,  movies,  e-
books,  and  video  games  estimated  to  be  valued  at  $54,000,  from  his  personal
computer  from  about  2011  to  present  without  authorization.  Applicant  admits  the
allegation. In his Response he clarifies that he has not been continuously downloading
illegal content since 2011. He  breaks  down the  times  he  illegally downloaded material
and  explains  where  there  were  multi-year  gaps.  He  started  downloading  sometime
between 2011 and 2015 and was “halted again” after his security clearance interview in
July 2022 so it was “only 15 years total, with a 6-year break in the middle” vice 20 years.
(Response at 2; Item 4.) He provides a detailed breakdown of the items in his Response
to get to the $54,000 figure and then notes that with subscription services the present-
day value according to his breakdown is $6,360. He notes he voluntarily reported these
in his interview. (Response at 2; Item 3 at 17; Item 4 at 7, 16.) He explains in his Response
that his “illegal downloading in general has just been a hobby, not a habit, which makes
it easy to halt.” Now that he is aware of the implications to his security clearance, he has
made  efforts  to  halt  any  illegal  downloading  and  deleted  any  illegal  content  from  his
computers. (Response at 3.)
SOR ¶  2.c: Applicant loaded a Tor Internet browser onto his personal laptop,
between 2015 and 2018 and accessed an illegal marketplace on the dark web where
he  viewed  pictures  on  sale  of  women  that  were  taken  without  their  consent.
Applicant admits the allegation. He states in his Answer and Response this was a onetime
event that occurred one evening somewhere between 2015 and 2018. He thought  “the
dark  web  would  have  strange-but-benign  websites  to  explore,  though  the  links  were
sometimes unlabeled. That website was an “uncomfortable experience,”  and he states
he does not intend to go back to the Tor browser, the dark web, or to  similar websites
ever again. (Answer; Item 4 at 16-17.) There is no evidence that Applicant’s accessing
the dark web was illegal. He stated in response to Government interrogatories that his
accessing of the dark web was not part of a search for illegal content or to commit illegal
acts. There is no evidence he used the dark web to sell or purchase illegal firearms, drugs,
pornography,  stolen  passwords,  hacked  credit  card  account  numbers,  or  other  illegal
items  associated  with  the  dark  web.  He  stated  in  the  Government  interrogatories  he
thought the worst thing he saw on the dark web was a site selling pictures of adult women
without their consent and affirmed he “did not purchase anything, nor view illegal content.”
(Item  3  at  19.)  He  repeatedly  denied  to  the  investigator  viewing  any  type  of  illegal
pornography. (Item 4 at 17.)
SOR ¶  2.d: Applicant illegally or when otherwise not authorized duplicated
video  games  for  LAN  parties  in  about  September  2001.  Applicant  admits  the
allegation. He states the video game duplication was a way to let everyone at the LAN
party join in the gaming, so no one was left out. (Item 3 at 17.) He notes his video-game
duplication activities ended a long time ago and will not reoccur because, with streaming
services,  it  is  now  easier  to  legally  acquire  games.  He  states  he  has  “deleted  any
remaining  illegal  content  on  my  technology,  and  [he]  will  not  illegally  download  or
duplicate anything in the future.” (Answer at 2.)

occurring   when   he   was  a   student   when   he   had   little  income.  As   an   indication   of  his
rehabilitation,  he notes  “stopped any kind of illegal  or gray-area  downloading  [in October

As further mitigation Applicant offers in his Response that he is an honest person.
He achieved “life rank” in the Boy Scouts. He abided by the alcohol laws and did not drink

"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  since  September  2018.  He  received  an  associate  degree  from  a  technical
institute in July 2008. He has never married and has no children.
Applicant worked in non-federal jobs after receiving his associate degree until he
was hired by a federal contractor in July 2009. He received a security clearance in June
2009.  From  August  2009  to  August  2012,  he  was  assigned  to  duties  as  a  contractor
employee  with  U.S.  Marines  in  an  overseas  location.  While  assigned  to  duty  with  the
Marines, he was reprimanded by his civilian employer for his conduct on one occasion.
The  record  does  not  reflect  the  conduct  for  which  he  was  reprimanded.  After  his
employer’s contract ended in August 2012, he worked for other federal contractors. At the
time he submitted his SCA, he had been working for a federal contractor since October
2017. He was terminated from this employment in August 2018 for reasons set out in the
SOR, and he was hired by his current employer shortly thereafter.
Applicant’s  job  description  while  working  for  his  former  employer  as  the  senior
systems  administrator  made  him  responsible  for  “ensuring  the  reliable  operation  of  IT
systems.” His specific duties and responsibilities included providing server management
of  classified  and  unclassified  networks;  providing  configuration,  support,  maintenance,
and  troubleshooting  of  systems,  servers,  and  desktops;  and  establishing  scripts  to
automate the team’s infrastructure task, patching, and other operations duties. (GX- 3 at
20)
Applicant testified that his first year with his former employer went well, but after
the  leadership  changed,  several  employees  were  replaced  with  outsiders  who  had
worked  for  the  new  leadership.  Because  he  did  not  believe  that  the  new  leadership
understood the requirements of his job, he began searching for a new job. He accepted
an offer from his current employer while still working for his former employer. (Tr. 15-16)
Applicant  testified  that  on  August  20,  2018,  while  he  was  still  employed  by  his
former employer, he was verbally informed by his immediate supervisor that he was being
terminated because of his “hostile behavior” toward a senior executive of the company at
a meeting two days earlier, by removing his glasses and rubbing his forehead while the
senior executive was speaking. Applicant testified that he was upset at being terminated
and asked his supervisor what the real reason was for his termination.  (Tr. 22) On the
same day, he sent an email to his supervisor denying that he acted aggressively at the
meeting with the senior executive. (AX F at 4)
On  August  23,  2018,  Applicant’s  supervisor  sent  him  an  email  alleging  eight
concerns that had arisen since April 2018 and were the basis for his termination. Applicant
testified that he did not receive this email, which was sent to his father’s email address.
(GX  3  at  2;  Tr.  24)  Five  concerns  were  incorporated  into  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  alleging
concerns  under  Guideline  K.  SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleged  the  same  five  concerns  under
Guideline M. The eight concerns in the former employer’s August 2018 email were copied
verbatim into SOR ¶ 3.a, alleging personal conduct under Guideline E.
The August 2018 email did not describe the evidence on which the eight concerns
were based. There is no evidence that the concerns were investigated before the email
was sent to Applicant. The concerns were described in general terms in the email, and
the SOR allegations incorporating them did not meet the specificity required by Directive
¶ E3.1.3 (SOR shall be a detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits).
The evidence pertaining to the allegations in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: Security  threats (attempting to  access  systems  without  clearance

attempts by Applicant to access systems without a proper clearance.
SOR  ¶   1.b:   Performing  systems   scans   not   within  requested  tasks   or  job
duties  (Concern #4). Applicant denied this allegation. The record contains no evidence
of instances when Applicant performed systems scans that were not within his assigned
duties.
SOR  ¶   1.c:  Attempting  to   secure   an  administrator  account   for  network
devices  without  a  top secret clearance  (Concern #5).  Applicant testified that he had
no memory of requesting an administrator account for himself. He believed that he had
all the access he needed to perform his job. (Tr. 31) In response to DOHA interrogatories,
he stated that the only times he submitted requests for new administrative accounts was
for new administrators joining the program. These requests were part of his duties as a
senior administrator. (GX 3 at 3, 5)
SOR ¶  1.d: Bringing a  personal  CD-ROM  into the  secure  workplace  (Concern
#6). Applicant admitted this allegation. He testified that he had a personal CD-ROM in his
gym bag, and he had forgotten that it was in his gym bag when he came to work. As soon
as he discovered it, he turned it in to his supervisor, because he knew that bringing it into
the workplace was a violation of his employer’s rules. (Tr. 28-29)
SOR ¶  1.e:  Returning to  the  secure  office  environment  after hours  for a  not
verifiable   or   reasonable   purpose   (Concern  #3).   Applicant  admitted  returning  to  the
office after hours for non-work purposes. He testified that there were occasions when he
missed  his  bus  during  cold  weather,  and  he  returned  to  the  office  to  wait  for  other
transportation. There were other team members still working while he was in the secure
area. There is no evidence that he engaged in any suspicious activity while in the office.
He testified that he was never told that he was forbidden to be in the office outside of his
prescribed work hours. (Tr. 34)
SOR ¶  2.a: Cross-alleges  SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.e  under  Guideline  M. The evidence is
the same as described above for SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e.
SOR ¶  2.b: Termination from employment  due to  concerns  in SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.e.
The  evidence  establishes  that  Applicant  was  terminated  for the  reasons  set  out  in  the
SOR. However, only SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e were supported by evidence in the record.
SOR ¶  3.a: Terminated from employment  for violations  alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.a-
1.e,  plus   Concern  #2   (Inability  to   mask   emotions  to   the   point   of   disrupting
meetings), Concern #7  (Repeated attire  and appearance  issues), and  Concern  #8
(Aggressive behavior during a customer/co-worker meeting).
The  record  contains  no  evidence  that  Applicant  disrupted  meetings.  When
Applicant was questioned by a security investigator about disruptive behavior at work, he
disclosed one occasion involving an exchange of words with a coworker about how to do
a job. He considered it to be no more than a disagreement. (GX 3 at 13) The only evidence
of  “aggressive  behavior”  was  the  accusation  of  his  supervisor  that  he  engaged  in
aggressive  behavior  by  removing  his  glasses  and  rubbing  his  head  while  a  senior
executive  was  speaking  at  a  meeting.  (Tr.  22)  There  is  no  evidence  of  the  attire  and
appearance  requirements  for  his  job  and  no  evidence  that  he  was  warned  about
inappropriate  attire.  To  the  contrary, a  co-worker submitted a  statement  that  Applicant
always wore appropriate attire and that he wore a shirt and tie every day even though
business casual was the norm. (AX A)
Two  senior  systems  engineers  employed  by  Applicant’s  former  employer
submitted statements rebutting the eight concerns about Applicant. One of them stated
that if he had any doubts about Applicant’s trustworthiness and professional behavior, he
would not have submitted his statement of support. (AX A; AX B)
Applicant testified that his overseas service with the Marine Corps was stressful.
In addition, his partner passed away in 2013. He believed that he was diagnosed  by a
psychiatrist  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.  He  is  currently  taking  medication  for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. (Tr. 35-38)
Applicant is highly regarded by his current employer. His senior program manager
and  program  director  each  submitted  letters  commenting  on  his  proficiency,  rigorous
adherence  to  information  security,  outstanding  interpersonal  skills,  and  ability  to  work
within a team. (AX C; AX D)

"Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  senior  program  manager  for  a  defense  contractor,
employed since August 2017. He previously worked as a senior staff project engineer for
another defense contractor from 2001 until he was suspended and resigned in June 2017.
He received two bachelor’s degrees in 1998 and 2000, a master’s degree in 2004, and a
doctorate degree in 2013. He married in 2000 and has four children, ages 10 through 17.
He testified that he has held DOD security clearances and special access program (SAP)
privileges  for  over  19  years.  He  reported  that  his  top-secret  clearance  was  granted  in
about 2003.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  M  (Use  of  Information  Technology)  that
Applicant resigned in June 2017 in lieu of termination after his employer discovered that
he misused a company computer to view pornography or adult-oriented material, and he
violated  security  protocols  by  using  a  personal  external  storage  device  on  a  company
computer.
The SOR alleges under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) that: (a) Applicant falsified
his September 2017 SCA by answering “no” to a question in Section 13C - Employment
Record, asking if he was fired from a job; quit after being told he would be fired; left a job
by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual
agreement after notice of unsatisfactory performance; received a written warning, been
officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such
as a violation of security policy; and (b) Applicant falsified his September 2017 SCA by
answering “no” to a question in  Section 27 –  Use of Information Technology Systems,
asking  if  he  introduced,  removed,  or  used  hardware,  software,  or  media  in  connection
with  any  information  technology  system  without  authorization,  when  specifically
prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations, or attempted any of the above.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used his work-issued laptop
to view sexually-explicit videos at his home with his wife. He claimed that on five to ten
occasions,  he inserted  a removable drive that  contained  sexually-explicit  videos into a
10
USB port on his company laptop to view with his wife. He denied that he resigned from
his job in lieu of termination; rather he averred that although he knew his actions could
result in  “future disciplinary action,” he resigned because he was embarrassed and his
reputation was tarnished at his workplace. (Ans.)
Applicant  also  denied  falsifying  his  SCA,  claiming  he  did  not  resign  under  an
“explicit or promise of future discipline” or for any other reason posed in the question 13C
on his SCA, and that an answer of “no” continues to be the correct answer. He also stated
that although his initial answer to SCA question 27 was “factually incorrect,” he did not
deliberately falsify his answer. He explained that he corrected his answer to question 27
after reviewing it with the investigator during his personal subject interview (PSI), and that
he  was  “open  and  candid  with  the  investigator  about  his  reasons  for  leaving”  his
employment.  (Ans.)  In  fact,  the  PSI  shows  that  Applicant  was  twice  asked  about  his
response to SCA question 13C regarding his suspension from employment, not question
27 regarding his use of information technology (IT) systems, where he changed his SCA
answer and admitted the violation. (GE 2.)
Applicant’s  work  for  his  previous  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  spanned  16
years and required security eligibility at the top-secret level, with special access program
privileges. He was a first-line manager and supervised other cleared employees. He was
trained on information security measures while employed with the company, and attended
required  security  briefings.  He  worked  within  a  DOD-designated  “closed  area”  where
phones,  personal  computers,  and  other  personal  devices  were  prohibited,  however
company-issued laptops were allowed into the area and were connected to company IT
systems  while  there.  Before  the  incidents  in  question,  Applicant  had  no  prior  security
infractions.
Applicant  used  his  work-issued  computer  to  view  pornography  installed  via  a
personal USB device (external hard drive). He testified that he used the USB device and
company computer to view pornography for four to six months, including with his spouse
and while on travel alone. He did not correct the length of time he used the device when
speaking to the government investigator, nor did he correct it on his PSI when he certified
its accuracy in response to Government interrogatories.
When the USB device was inserted into the computer,  a warning  banner appeared
on the screen that warned about moving information to or from the computer.  Applicant
admitted  in  his  PSI  that  he  knew   of  the  policy  prohibiting  employees  from  inserting
external  non-employment-approved hardware  into work devices  (GE  2.),  but  later testified
that the use of  a  personal  USB device  plugged into the  computer was a “grey area.” (Tr.
38)  Applicant   justified  his  actions  by  claiming   that  he  was  not  logged  into  a  company
network,   he  was  not  on  duty,  and   the  computer   was  not  used  for   classified   work.   He
testified that he  knew  viewing pornography on his company computer was  a violation of
company policy. (Tr. 38; AE L.)
Unbeknown  to  Applicant,  his  company  computer  was  being  monitored  by  his
employer, who discovered the improper activity and conducted an investigation. (GE 2;
11
GE  4.)   The  company’s  investigation  revealed  that   pornography  was  present   on
Applicant’s   USB  drive  and   that  using  a  company  computer   to  view  such  material  was
prohibited.   (GE  4.)  The  investigator  explained   to  Applicant   that  pornography  was  a
“commonly recognized threat  vector” and  a  method  for “placing malicious computer code
into a computer system or network.” (GE 4.) Applicant  confirmed that he also  used the
USB  device  while   on   a  recent  business  trip,  and   admitted  that  he  used  “absolutely
incredibly poor judgment in using the device.” (GE 4.)
Applicant also used the work computer to access an online website to view online
personal ads while on travel, and used “email to look for a meeting with other men.” (GE
4.) Applicant told the investigator that he was only “playing a game,” and that no meeting
occurred on his last trip, but admitted that he previously met with people  on two other
occasions but never discussed his work and had no continuing contact with either person.
(GE 4.) The company investigator explained to Applicant that “engaging in such activity
could  place  him  at  great  risk  physically  and  professionally  by  someone  he  met  by
attempting to harm or compromise him in some manner.” (GE 4.) Applicant’s use of the
company computer to arrange personal liaisons was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  carried  his  personal  USB  device  into  the  closed  work  area  in  his
briefcase,  in  violation  of  company  policy.  (GE  4;  AE  L.)  The  company  labeled  this  a
security  violation.  (AE  L.)  Contrary  to  his  testimony,  he  admitted  to  the  company
investigator that he knew using the USB device in his company computer was prohibited,
but he claimed he was “not sure” whether the device could be carried into the closed work
area. (GE 4.) In testimony, he stated that he did not know he was prohibited from taking
the device into the closed area, but he “should have  known.”  (Tr. 34-37.) Introducing a
prohibited device into the closed work area was not alleged in the SOR.
In a subsequent statement addressed to the company disciplinary review board
(DRB), Applicant stated that he “exercised some very poor judgment in [his] personal life
and does not dispute any of the facts as presented to [him] by the investigators.” (GE 4 –
Statement.)  He  pleaded  with  the  DRB  that  he  would  accept  any  disciplinary  action
mandated if they allowed him to continue employment, but if that was not possible, he
requested that the DRB allow him to resign or impose a form of termination that might
allow him a clean start in another industry. (GE 4 – Statement.)
Applicant  was  stripped  of  his  access  badge  and  was  placed  on  indefinite
disciplinary  suspension  pending  a  formal  disposition  of  the  DRB.  (GE  4;  AE  L.)  The
company reported Applicant’s conduct  to  DOD  via a JPAS incident  history  report,  and
noted that Applicant resigned via email on June 22, 2017, the day before the DRB. The
company noted that Applicant’s resignation was “in lieu of termination,” and he was not
eligible  for  rehire.  (GE  3;  AE  L.)  Applicant  was  aware  that  the  DRB  could  result  in
disciplinary  action  or  termination  of  employment,  and  testified  that  he  was  concerned
about his reputation in the company and believed a “negative” DRB outcome would limit
his ability to retain a security clearance. (Tr. 21-26.) In testimony, he quibbled regarding
the labeling of his suspension, calling it “administrative leave,” not a suspension, because
he was not formally notified of a suspension and was paid. (Tr. 41.)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  August  2018  (PSI)
while  he  was  employed  by  another  defense  contractor.  He  did  not  initially  reveal  his
suspension and full involvement in the misuse of the company computer. He was twice
asked if he had received a written reprimand, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or
disciplined for misconduct in the workplace such as a violation of security policy, and he
twice answered “no.” When confronted with his suspension from his previous employer,
he hesitated before admitting that he was suspended for inserting personal hardware into
his work computer to view pornography. (GE 2.)
When  asked  by  the  investigator  whether  he  introduced,  removed  or  used
hardware,  software,  or  media  in  connection  with  any  information  technology  system
without  authorization  when  specifically  prohibited,  he  stated  “yes.”  He  claimed  he
misunderstood the related question on his SCA when he answered “no” to question 27,
but did not elaborate on what he misunderstood. (GE 2.) In testimony, Applicant claimed
that he answered “no” to question 27 because he believed the question was limited to
classified  systems,  despite  that  it  specifically  referred  to  “any  information  technology
system.” (Tr. 27-29.) He testified that he finally understood that his answer on the SCA
was  incorrect  after  the  investigator  repeated  the  question  with  an  emphasis  on  “any”
system.  I  note  that  the  PSI  does  not  indicate  that  Applicant  was  coached  by  the
investigator or that the investigator had to emphasize any particular part of SCA question
27,  rather  the  investigator  noted  that  she  twice  asked  Applicant  to  disclose  his
employment  record  in  response  to  SCA  question  13C,  before  he  acknowledged  his
suspension.
Applicant  explained  to  the  Government  investigator  that  he  used  the  USB  and
computer to view pornography with his wife in their bedroom, but he did not disclose that
he also used it while alone on a business trip, or that he searched personal ads, used
email to arrange liasons while traveling, or that he introduced the prohibited USB device
into a closed work area in violation of security regulations and company policy. (GE 2.)
He acknowledged in his interview that he was aware that inserting his personal USB into
the computer to view pornography was prohibited, and claimed, contrary to his hearing
testimony,  that  he  did  so  “many  times  in  a  month  to  two  months  timeframe.”  (GE  2.)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  misuse  of  the  computer  violated  company  policy  and
took full responsibility for  his actions. He  claimed he had a “terrible  lapse of judgment”
and became “impulsive.” He explained that he did not disclose his conduct on his SCA
because  he  interpreted  the  question  (SCA  question  27)  as  strictly  related  to  violating
“security policies.” (GE 2.)
Applicant disputes that he was “suspended” and resigned in lieu of termination or
by mutual agreement. Applicant testified that he was not formally suspended, rather he
was simply on paid administrative leave. He also testified that he did not resign by mutual
agreement  or  in  lieu  of  termination  because  he  resigned  the  day  before  the  DRB  was
scheduled  to  meet,  and  he  was  not  told  he  would  be  fired.  However,  in  his  PSI,  he
admitted that he was “suspended with pay for a week.” (GE 2.) He further explained in
his  PSI  that  he  “was  told  that  he  was  being  suspended  for  [a]  week  pending  the
disciplinary board’s decision. [Applicant] went home on paid suspension and after a week,
13
he resigned. He was not told he would be fired but he was afraid of having his security
clearance revoked by the disciplinary board.” (GE 2.) Applicant did not change or correct
this language when he verified the PSI’s accuracy in response to an interrogatory.
In SCA question 13A regarding Applicant’s employment history, he was asked for
the reason he left employment. Applicant answered that he “resigned to take position at
[another defense contractor].” (GE 1. p.14.) In addition, when asked if he left employment
by “mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct” or “following notice
of  unsatisfactory  performance,”  Applicant  answered  “no.”  (GE  1.  p.14.)  However,
Applicant did not have a new position with his current employer at the time he resigned.
(Tr. 48.) He testified that after resigning, he contacted a program director with another
government contractor whom Applicant met while conducting business with his previous
employer.  According  to  the  program  director  that  conducted  the  interview,  Applicant
disclosed that he made a “personal mistake and had inappropriately used an unclassified
[company]-owned  laptop  computer.  As  a  result  of  that  incident,  he  was  personally
embarrassed  and felt that the incident would have lasting negative impact on his ability
for  career advancement” with the company. (AE E.) The new employer concluded that
Applicant had a “significant lapse in judgment and that it violated [his company’s] policy,
it  was  not  a  security  infraction.”  Applicant  was  hired  in  the  summer  of  2017,  and  is
currently  employed  in  substantially  the  same  classified  work  he  performed  with  his
previous  employer.  The  evidence  is  unclear  as  to  what,  if  any,  other  information  was
provided to the new employer regarding Applicant’s previous employment conduct, and
on  what  basis  it  determined  that  Applicant’s  actions  did  not  qualify  as  a  “security
infraction.”
In his PSI, Applicant acknowledged his lack of judgment when using the company
computer,  and  attributed  it  his  “ignorance  and  careless  actions.”  (GE  2.)  He  took
accountability for his “mistake” and learned a lifelong lesson. He avers that he hopes to
put the incident behind him, but asserts that use of the USB device in the computer “did
not  put  the  company’s  security  at  risk  and  no  data  or  PII  was  lost.  (GE  2.)  Of  note,
Applicant continued to under report the extent of his use of the USB and company laptop
when he completed an “Affidavit of [Applicant]” in April 2020. In the affidavit, he admitted
to violating company rules by viewing the pornography with his wife, but failed to disclose
his  use  while  on  travel.  (AE  J.)  He  also  continues  to  deny  that  he  has  breached  any
security  protocols  by  stating  “for  all  of  my  19  year  career,  I  have  not  had  single  [sic]
infraction or incident involving any security issues.”
In a review by Applicant’s former employer, they noted in a letter dated June 11,
2020 that:
When [the company] representatives interviewed [Applicant],  he admitted
to viewing the materials using his [company] asset and understanding that
such  actions  were  prohibited.  As  such,  [Applicant]  was  placed  on  an
indefinite  disciplinary  suspension  pending  formal  determination  by  the
Disciplinary Review Board (DRB). [Applicant] was offered the opportunity to
provide  a  written  statement,  which  he  did.  In  that  statement,  [Applicant]
14
admits to the misconduct,  stating, ‘I am not attempting to defend or justify
my actions in  any way . . .’ and, ‘I  know  I’m in  no position to ask for favors
and  will accept whatever decision [the DRB] reache[es].’ On June 23, 2017,
the  date  the  DRB  was  scheduled  to  meet,   [Applicant]   tendered  his
resignation.
In  light  of  the  nature  of  the  substantiated  misconduct,   [Applicant’s]  Top
Secret  clearance, and  resignation while on a disciplinary suspension, [the
company] appropriately coded  [Applicant’s] resignation as a ‘resignation in
lieu  of  termination.’  Such  is  consistent  with  [the  company’s]  policy  and
procedures, and  its obligation as a federal  contractor  and  applicable law.
(AE L.)
Applicant’s current  employer fully supports him,  has promoted him  to manage a
highly-classified sub-product line that generates $125 million in annual sales, highlighted
his accomplishments, trustworthiness, and importance to the company and to the U.S.
national defense industry. The employer notes that they do not have another leader of
Applicant’s caliber waiting in the wings to replace him. (AE E.)
Likewise, Applicant’s former coworkers expressed their strong support for him and
discussed the harm that would occur to his new employer and the Government if Applicant
does not retain his security clearance and continue work on important, highly-classified
projects. (AE F, G.) Applicant’s  spouse also supports him and acknowledged that their
use of the company computer to view pornography together was an “egregious error.”
