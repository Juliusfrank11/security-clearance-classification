I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b-1.g:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United  States  to  continue  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.
Clearance is denied.
