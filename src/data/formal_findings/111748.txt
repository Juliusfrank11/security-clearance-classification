Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to
continue  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  a  public  trust  position.  Eligibility  for  a  public  trust
position is denied.
