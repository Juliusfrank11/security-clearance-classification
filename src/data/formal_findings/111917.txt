I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.j:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
