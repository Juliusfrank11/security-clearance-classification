As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b – 1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to
grant  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a  security  clearance.  Eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information is denied.
