Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:
For Applicant
22 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016).
23 Applicant’s loss of employment and his wife’s loss of employment are circumstances largely beyond his
control, which mitigates the filing of Chapter 13 bankruptcies to protect their home from foreclosure under
AG  ¶  20(b).  Failure  to  pay  income  taxes,  while  understandable  under  these  circumstances,  is  not
responsible  conduct  under  AG  ¶  20(b).  Therefore,  Applicant  gets  only  partial  credit  under  AG  ¶  20(b).
Applicant’s  current  Chapter  13  plan,  although  it  includes  payments  of  back  taxes,  is  not  technically  an
arrangement with the appropriate tax authorities. I find, however, that it is the functional equivalent of such
an arrangement such that AG ¶ 20(g) applies.
24 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)-(9).
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
