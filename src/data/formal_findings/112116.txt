Subparagraphs 3.a-3.d:                                            For Applicant
Conclusions
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  access  to  classified
information.  Clearance is denied.
