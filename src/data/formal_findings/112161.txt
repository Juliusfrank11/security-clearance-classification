I have reconsidered my findings in accordance with the Appeal Board remand.  I
make the following findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.d-1.f:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c:
For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):
FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:
For Applicant
Conclusion
Upon  reconsideration,  I  adhere to my  conclusion  that  it  is not  clearly  consistent
with  the  national  security  interests  of  the  United  States  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
