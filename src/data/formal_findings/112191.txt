26 I cannot consider the recently filed lien for back state unemployment compensation taxes, because it is
not  alleged in the  SOR. I can,  however, consider the  lien  in  weighing mitigation,  whether Applicant has
demonstrated  sufficient  rehabilitation,  under  the  whole  person  concept,  and  in  weighing  Applicant's
credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). It appears that the lien was filed due to
an  inadvertent  error  by  Applicant  that  dramatically  increased  the  tax  due.  He  promptly  entered  into  a
payment plan with the state taxing authority. That weighs in favor of Applicant’s credibility.
27 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)-(9). I gave positive weight to the character reference letters Applicant submitted.
