I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1. Guideline B:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:
Against Applicant
13
Conclusion
In light of all the record evidence, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the
national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to
classified information. Clearance is denied.
