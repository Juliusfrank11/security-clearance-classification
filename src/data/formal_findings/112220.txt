Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-h:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

2 Applicant completed her security clearance application in  August 2014 and  was interviewed  in  August
2015.  The  SOR  was  not  issued  until  December  2017,  after  Applicant  was  already  addressing  her  tax
problems. There is nothing in the record suggesting that Applicant was motivated by the security clearance
process  to  clean  up  her  tax  problems.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  10-05909  at  3-4  (App.  Bd.  Sep.  27,  2012)
(Applicant paid his tax debts three months before the hearing). Applicantâ€™s testimony, which I found credible,
was that she began addressing consumer debt before tax liabilities to avoid garnishments.
