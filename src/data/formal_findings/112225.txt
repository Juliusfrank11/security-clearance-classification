I  have  reconsidered  my  formal  findings  in  accordance  with  the  Appeal  Board
remand. My findings on the allegations in the SOR are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.n:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility is denied.
