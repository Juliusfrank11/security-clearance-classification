Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
FOR APPLICANT
47 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).
48 As noted above, while Applicant initially applied for a position of public trust, his current position
with the civil-service is not a position of public trust, but rather a position that requires a secret clearance.
The adjudicative standards for both are identical. My decision would be the same whether his position is a
public trust position or requires access to classified information.

Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o.:
For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:
FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a.:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent  with  the national  interest  to  grant Applicant  eligibility  for a  position  of  public
trust to support a contract with the DOD, or a security clearance.  Eligibility is granted.
