Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:

Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.d - 1.f:
For Applicant
2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individualâ€™s age
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence
or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;
(8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of  continuation  or
recurrence.
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
