In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context  of  the  findings  of  fact,  conclusions,  conditions,  and  the  factors  listed  above,  I
make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.e-1.n:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                             For Applicant
Conclusions
In  light  of  all  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is  not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicantâ€™s eligibility to
hold a security clearance. Clearance is denied.
