In  reviewing  the  allegations  of  the  SOR  in  the  context  of  the  findings  of  fact,
conclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate
formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.
GUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):           AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:
Against Applicant
GUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):          AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a:                                   Against Applicant
Subparagraph 2.b:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance.
Clearance is denied.
