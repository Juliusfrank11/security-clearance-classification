Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a:
Subparagraphs 1.b-1.c:
For Applicant5
Against Applicant
4 The factors under AG ¶ 2(d) are as follows:
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which  participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other
permanent  behavioral  changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for
pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of  continuation  or
recurrence.
5 A favorable finding is returned as to SOR ¶ 1.a because treatment is viewed favorably, especially when it is
voluntary, and there is no history of treatment and relapse. SOR ¶ 1.b is resolved against Applicant because of
the serious relapse triggering the need for detoxification after a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.

Conclusion
In  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances,  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the  national
interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
