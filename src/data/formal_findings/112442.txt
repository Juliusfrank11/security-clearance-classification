7 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only
after  his  security  clearance  was  in  jeopardy  undercuts  a  determination  that  Applicant  has  rehabilitated
himself  and  does  not  reflect  the  voluntary  compliance  of  rules  and  regulations  expected  of  someone
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4
(App.  Bd.  Oct.  30,  2014)  (reversing  grant  of  a  security  clearance,  noting  not  all  tax  returns  filed,  and
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income
of  over  $200,000  and  discounted  his  non-tax  expenses,  contributions  to  DOD,  and  spouse’s  medical
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and
systems  is  essential  for  protecting  classified  information.”  Id.  at  5  (citing  ISCR  Case  No.  01-05340  at  3
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
