I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1. Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.c-1.d:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.e-1.f:
For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.g:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for
the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of
continuation or recurrence.
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
