I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a:
Against Applicant
3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individualâ€™s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6)
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for
the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of
continuation or recurrence.
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
