Paragraph 1, Guideline B:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.e:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United
States  to  grant  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Clearance  is
denied.
