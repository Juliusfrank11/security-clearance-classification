Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not
clearly  consistent  with  the  interests  of  national  security  to  grant  Applicant  a  security
clearance.  National  security  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  or  to  hold  a
sensitive position is denied.
