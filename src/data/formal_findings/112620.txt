In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context  of  the  findings  of  fact,  conclusions,  conditions,  and  the  factors  listed  above,  I
make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c-1.d:
Subparagraph 1.b:
For Applicant
Against Applicant
Conclusions
In  light  of  all  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is  not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant  or continue Applicantâ€™s eligibility to
hold a security clearance. Clearance is denied.
