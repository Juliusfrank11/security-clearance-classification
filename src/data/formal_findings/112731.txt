AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline B:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
