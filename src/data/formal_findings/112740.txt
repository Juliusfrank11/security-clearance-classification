Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:
For Applicant
9 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd.
May. 31, 2011): “Depending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant’s debts will not be paid
off for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.”
Conclusion
It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
