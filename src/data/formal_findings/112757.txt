In  reviewing  the  allegations  of  the  SOR  in  the  context  of  the  findings  of  fact,
conclusions,  and  the  factors  and  conditions  listed  above,  I  make  the  following
separate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.
GUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.g:
Against Applicant
13
Conclusions
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  access  to  classified
information.  Clearance is denied.
