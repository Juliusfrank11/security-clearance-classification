Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.o:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  national  security  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a
public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.

9 Applicant stated that she is willing to provide the DOD with updates on the status of the bankruptcy. The
adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility “despite the presence of issue
information  that  can  be  partially  but  not  completely  mitigated,  with  the  provision  that  additional  security
measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).” I have not done so as I have concluded the issues
are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to monitor Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.
