I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:
For Applicant
2  The  factors  are:  (1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the  circumstances
surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the
conduct;  (4)  the  individualâ€™s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent  to  which
participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other  permanent  behavioral
changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
Conclusion
I  conclude  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  security  interests  of  the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is granted.
