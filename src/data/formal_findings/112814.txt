Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.j:
For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):

Subparagraph 2.a:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
