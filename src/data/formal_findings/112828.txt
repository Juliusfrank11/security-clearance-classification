4  Appendix  C  of  Security  Executive  Agent  Directive  (SEAD)  4  grants  DOHA  administrative  judges  the
discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an
issue(s) that can be partially but not completely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures.
See also Memorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January 12, 2018
(“Appendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making adjudicative decisions to
grant  initial  or  continued  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  or  to  hold  a  sensitive  position  .  .  .
Effective  immediately,  authority  to  grant  clearance  eligibility  with  one  of  the  exceptions  enumerated  in
Appendix  C  is  granted  to  any  adjudicative,  hearing,  or  appeal  official  or  entity  now  authorized  to  grant
clearance eligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.”)
