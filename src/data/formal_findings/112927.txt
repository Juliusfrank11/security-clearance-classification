In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I
make the following formal findings:

Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:
Against Applicant
Conclusions
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, conclusions
are warranted that it is not  clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or contin-
ue Applicantâ€™s security clearance.  Clearance is denied.
