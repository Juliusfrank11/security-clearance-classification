As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
