Guideline F, Financial Considerations
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United
States  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Clearance  is
denied.
