I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
