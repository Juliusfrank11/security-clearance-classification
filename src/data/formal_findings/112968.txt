make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a-1.c:
Subparagraphs 1.d 1.e:
Against Applicant
For Applicant
Conclusions
In  light  of  all  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is  not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to
hold a security clearance. Clearance is denied.
