Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United
States  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Clearance  is
denied.
