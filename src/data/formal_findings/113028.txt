Guideline F, Financial Considerations:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United
States  to  grant  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Clearance  is
denied.
