In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I
make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):   AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h                                    Against Applicant
GUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:                                    Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue Applicantâ€™s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Clearance
is denied.
