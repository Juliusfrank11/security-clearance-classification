Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.y:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:
FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
