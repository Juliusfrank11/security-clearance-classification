I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I  conclude  that  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information
is denied.
