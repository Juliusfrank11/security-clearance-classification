I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1. Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
