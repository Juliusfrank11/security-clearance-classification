9  The  SOR  cross-allegation  under  Guideline  E  for  personal  conduct  concerns  Applicant’s  questionable
judgment  in  light  of  his  cocaine  use.  After  considering  the  applicable  disqualifying  and  mitigating
conditions  under  Guideline  E,  the  matter  is  decided  against  Applicant  under  the  rationale  discussed
above under Guideline H. Further discussion under Guideline E is redundant.
