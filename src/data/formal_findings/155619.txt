I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence:  FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I  conclude  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  security  interests  of  the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is granted.
