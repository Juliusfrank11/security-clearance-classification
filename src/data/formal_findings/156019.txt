I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior):   AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):   AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  2.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
