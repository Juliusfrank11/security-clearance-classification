I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1. Guideline J:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a  and 1.b:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline D:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  1.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light  of  the  entire  record,  I  conclude  that  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the
national security interests of the United States to grant Applicantâ€™s eligibility for access to
classified information. Clearance is denied.
