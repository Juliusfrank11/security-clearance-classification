Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline J:
AGAINST  APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
Against  Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline F:
AGAINST A  PPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a and 2.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to
grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  public  trust  position.  Eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive
information is denied.
