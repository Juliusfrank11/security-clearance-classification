I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline D:
AGAINST A  PPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2. Guideline J:
AGAINST  APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
Against  Applicant
11
Conclusion
In  light  of  the  entire  record,  I  conclude  that  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the
national security interests of the United States to grant Applicantâ€™s eligibility for access to
classified information. Clearance is denied.
