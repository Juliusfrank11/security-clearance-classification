Michael H. Leonard
Administrative Judge
9  The June 2017 drunk-driving incident in SOR ¶ 2.a is decided for Applicant. His questionable judgment
in  light  of  the  incident  is  mitigated  by  the  passage  of  time  without  recurrence,  his  participation  in  an
alcohol-counseling program, and his modified consumption of alcohol.
10  The cross-allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b concerns Applicant’s questionable judgment in light of his  marijuana
use. After considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, the matter
is decided against Applicant under the rationale discussed above under Guideline H. Further discussion
under Guideline E is redundant.
