I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1. Guideline H:
AGAINST  APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:
Against  Applicant
Conclusion
In  light  of  the  entire  record,  I  conclude  that  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the
national security interests of the United States to grant Applicantâ€™s eligibility for access to
classified information. Clearance is denied.
