The formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:

Subparagraphs  1.a  â€“  1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light  of  the  record  as  a  whole,  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the  national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a  security clearance. National security eligibility
is denied.
