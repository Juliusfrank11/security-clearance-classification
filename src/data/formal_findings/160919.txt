Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
falsification  mitigated  under  a  “whole  person”  analysis,  namely  that  Applicant  has
matured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid
in relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so
that there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge’s conclusion runs contrary
to the Judge’s rejection of  Applicant’s explanations for the security clearance application
falsification.  At  the  hearing  (after  earlier  admitting  the  falsification  in  her  March  2003
written  statement  to  a  security  investigator),  Applicant  testified  that  she  had  not
intentionally  falsified  her  application.  Given  the  Judge’s  rejection  of  this  explanation  as
not  being  credible,  it  follows  that  the  Judge  could  not  have  concluded  Applicant  now
recognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior.
