I have reopened the record in accordance with the Appeal Board mandate, and I
have adhered to my previous findings, which are as follows:
Paragraph  1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I  conclude  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  security  interests  of  the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is granted.
