Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.d:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
