I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
AGAINST A  PPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:
AGAINST  APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
