I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):
AGAINST A  PPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f and 1.h-1.j:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.k:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
