I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST A  PPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b-1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
