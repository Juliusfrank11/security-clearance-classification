The  formal findings on  the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a  â€“  1.j:
Against  Applicant
In  light of  the record as  a whole,  it is not clearly consistent with  the  interests of
national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.
