Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.h:
AGAINST A  PPLICANT
Against  Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant’s
application for a security clearance is denied.
