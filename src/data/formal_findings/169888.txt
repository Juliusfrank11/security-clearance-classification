to the Judge’s rejection of  Applicant’s explanations for the security clearance application
falsification.  At  the  hearing  (after  earlier  admitting  the  falsification  in  her  March  2003
written  statement  to  a  security  investigator),  Applicant  testified  that  she  had  not
intentionally  falsified  her  application.  Given  the  Judge’s  rejection  of  this  explanation  as
not  being  credible,  it  follows  that  the  Judge  could  not  have  concluded  Applicant  now
recognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior.

Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
