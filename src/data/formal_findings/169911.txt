Formal findings for or  against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph  1.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

1  The  adjudicative  guidelines  give me the  authority  to grant conditional  eligibility  “despite the  presence of
issue   information   that  can   be   partially   but  not  completely   mitigated,  with  the   provision  that  additional
security  measures  shall  be  required  to mitigate  the  issue(s).”  I have not done so as  the  issue  in this  case
is  not partially mitigated.
