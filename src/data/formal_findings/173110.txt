I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:

Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):   AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.c:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
