The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:
Against  Applicant
Subparagraph 1.a:
Against  Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.
