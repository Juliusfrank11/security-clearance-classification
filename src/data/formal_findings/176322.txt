Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.i:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

1.  The  adjudicative guidelines  give me the  authority  to grant conditional  eligibility  “despite the  presence of
issue   information   that  can   be   partially   but  not  completely   mitigated,  with  the   provision  that  additional
security  measures  shall  be required to mitigate  the  issue(s).”  I have not done so  as  I have concluded  the
issues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary  to further monitor Applicant’s finances.
