The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a  â€“  1.k:
Against Applicant
In  light of  the record as  a whole,  it is  not clearly consistent with  the  interests of
national security to grant Applicant eligibility to hold a public trust position.
