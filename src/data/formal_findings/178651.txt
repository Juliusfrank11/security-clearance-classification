I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
AGAINST  APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a:
Against  Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of
the United States to grant or continue Applicant’s national security eligibility for access to
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
