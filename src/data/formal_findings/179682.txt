I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:

Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.c-1.g:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.h-1.j:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
