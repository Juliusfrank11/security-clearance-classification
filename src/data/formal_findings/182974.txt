I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b, and  1.d-1.j:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph  1.c:
For Applicant

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United  States  to  continue  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.
Clearance is denied.
