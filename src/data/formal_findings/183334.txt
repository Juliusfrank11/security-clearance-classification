1  The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority  to grant conditional  eligibility  “despite the  presence of
issue  information  that  can  be  partially  but  not  completely  mitigated,  with  the  provision  that  additional
security  measures  shall  be required to mitigate  the  issue(s).”  I have not done so   as I have concluded the
issues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant.
