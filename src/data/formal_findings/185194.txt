Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.h:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.e, 1.g:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to
grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is
denied.
