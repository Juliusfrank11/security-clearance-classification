Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  1.a:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph  1.b:
Against  Applicant,  except  for  his
2012  and  2013  state  income  tax
returns,  which  I  find  in  favor  of
Applicant.
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
