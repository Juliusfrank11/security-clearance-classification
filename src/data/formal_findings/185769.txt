Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.b:
Against   Applicant   (except  for  tax
year  2017,  which  is  found   for
Applicant)
Conclusion
It  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

2  The  adjudicative  guidelines  give me the  authority  to grant conditional  eligibility  “despite the  presence of
issue   information   that  can   be   partially   but  not  completely   mitigated,  with  the   provision  that  additional
security  measures  shall   be  required   to mitigate   the  issue(s).”  I have not  done   so as  I  have  concluded a
conditional clearance in this case is not warranted.
