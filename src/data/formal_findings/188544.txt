As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light of the record as  a whole, it is not clearly  consistent with the  interests of
national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
