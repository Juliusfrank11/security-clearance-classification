I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  E:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs  1.a  &  1.c:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph1.b:
Against Applicant
For Applicant, in part, excepting
“and sustained  by the  MSPB”
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United  States  to  grant  or  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information. National security eligibility is denied.
