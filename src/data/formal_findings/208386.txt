1  In   Applicant’s   SOR  answer,   she   requested   consideration  of  a  waiver   with  appropriate  conditions.  The
adjudicative guidelines  give me  the  authority  to grant  conditional  eligibility  “despite the presence of issue
information   that  can  be  partially   but  not  completely   mitigated,  with  the   provision  that  additional   security
measures  shall  be  required  to mitigate the issue(s).”  I have not done so  as  I have  concluded  a conditional
clearance in this case is not warranted.

Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  security  to  grant  Applicant’s  eligibility  for a  security
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
