As required  by section  E3.1.25  of Enclosure  3  of the  Directive,  I make  the  following
formal findings on the  SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  1.a:
Withdrawn
Subparagraphs 1.b-1.f:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline E:
FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph  2.a:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to sensitive information.
