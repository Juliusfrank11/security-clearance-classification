As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g:
For Applicant
Conclusion
I  conclude  that  it  is  not  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant
Applicantâ€™s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information
is denied.
