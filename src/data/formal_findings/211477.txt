I make the following formal findings on the allegation in the SOR:
Paragraph  1: Guideline  H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  1.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to
grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is
denied.
