Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance.  In  the  future,  with  an  extended  period  of  abstinence  from  drugs,  and  with
truthful  responses  on  his  SF-86,  Applicant  may  again  seek  a  security  clearance.
However, at present his national security eligibility for access to classified information is
denied.
