AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs  1.a-1.c:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance
is denied.
