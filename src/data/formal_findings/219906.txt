I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of
national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
