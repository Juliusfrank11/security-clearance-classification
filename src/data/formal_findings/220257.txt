Subparagraphs  1.a  - 1.d:
Against Applicant (For Applicant for tax
year 2020)
Paragraph  2, Guideline  E:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  2.a:
Against Applicant (For Applicant for tax

Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United
States  to  grant  or  continue  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
