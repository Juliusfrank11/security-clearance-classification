I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:
Paragraph  1, Guideline F:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs  1.a  - 1.l:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United
States  to  grant  or  continue  Applicantâ€™s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
