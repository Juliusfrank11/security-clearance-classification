KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant had four delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,785. He claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain those accounts in a current status, and he admitted that as of the date the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued (September 11, 2020), the accounts were still delinquent. He spent money to take several trips to Poland during his period of reported insufficient funds. Months after the SOR was issued, he obtained a debt-consolidation loan, and he immediately resolved three of the four debts alleged in the SOR. His efforts with respect to the remaining debt have been rebuffed by the collection agent. While his resolution efforts were delayed, they were eventually positive and successful. His delayed actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is granted.
