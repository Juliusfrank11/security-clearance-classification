KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant has at least three delinquent student-loan accounts - opened between 2006 and 2010 - that were eventually placed for collection, totaling approximately $27,619. Although she initially claimed that her student loans had been paid off by her father, she eventually retreated from that position, and conceded that she was in the process of working with the U.S. Department of Education in resolving her accounts. First there was a purported deferment, and then there was discussion about a repayment plan. Applicant admitted that two of the student loans were still delinquent as of the date the SOR was issued. Instead of verifiably following through in attempting to resolve the accounts, or demonstrating through documentation that her father actually paid some of the loans, Applicant has relied on the arguments that some of the accounts are no longer in one of her most recent credit reports, or the loan was not valid. She made no verifiable efforts to investigate or attempt to resolve either her acknowledged student loans or her disputed student loans. Applicant’s inaction and unverifiable actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied.
