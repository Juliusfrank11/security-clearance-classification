KEYWORD:  Financial; criminal conduct; personal conduct

DIGEST: Applicant had ten delinquent Statement of Reasons (SOR)-alleged accounts totaling approximately $25,165, as well as a number of delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. Of his SOR-related debts, he has resolved most of them, and he is in the process of resolving the few remaining ones. He has also resolved debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He was discharged from the U.S. Army in 1987 and issued a general discharge under honorable conditions because of unsatisfactory performance, essentially related to repeated violations of military standards and requirements performance, and military disciplinary actions. In addition, during a 27-year period, ending in 2015, he was arrested and charged on 12 occasions for a variety of incidents, mostly involving his violent behavior with former girlfriends or family members. He was also issued a number of temporary peace orders restricting his ability to be near individuals or locations. He has not been involved in any criminal misconduct for over one-half decade, and he is remorseful about his past conduct. He acknowledged that he was “a screw up operating on auto pilot trying to find himself.” But, he has finally freed himself from the negativity of his troubled youth and early adulthood. Some of his character references substantiate the transition from an abused child, to a violent adult, and the transformation to a loving, caring, peaceful adult. Other character references attest to his excellent work performance and caring nature. Applicant’s actions no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is granted.
