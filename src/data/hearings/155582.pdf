KEYWORD:  Finances
			
DIGEST: Applicant acquired seven delinquent debts between about 2014 and 2017 most of which his now ex-wife was in charge of monitoring and making payments toward. Applicant did not know what she did with the accounts as he faced a two-year period of unemployment and she went missing. Applicant claimed to have worked with three creditors without substantiating documentation. He denies a medical debt but has not disputed it. He is waiting for his ex-wife to return to discuss other debts. Meanwhile, he has sufficient net income to be making strides with his delinquent accounts. Applicant filed to mitigate security concerns. Clearance is denied.
