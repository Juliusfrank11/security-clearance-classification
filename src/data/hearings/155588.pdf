KEYWORD:  Drug Involvement, Personal Conduct
			
DIGEST: Applicant disclosed past marijuana use before being granted access to classified information in 2009. When her jurisdiction decriminalized personal use of the drug, she resumed her marijuana use, knowing the drug remained illegal at the federal level. This drug use continued until it jeopardized her employment, about two years ago, at which point she quit using marijuana. Insufficient time has passed to demonstrate her ability to refrain from drug use, and insufficient information was provided as to how she intends to maintain her abstinence. Drug involvement and personal conduct security concerns remain unmitigated. Clearance denied.
