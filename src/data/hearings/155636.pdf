KEYWORD:  Criminal Conduct; Personal Conduct

DIGEST: During the three year period from 2016 through 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged on seven different occasions for a variety of incidents, with all but one of those incidents involving alleged violent behavior with the same woman – the mother of one of his children – who, since he was able to obtain joint custody of their daughter in 2015, reported him to police and lodged the complaints that led to his arrests. All of the six arrests eventually resulted in all charges being dismissed nolle prosequi or placed on the Stet calendar. The one other incident, in 2017, was isolated and unrelated to the others, as it was for several driving violations, including driving while intoxicated, for which he was fined and ordered to perform community service. He was also fired from one position for falling asleep during his working shift. Applicant’s actions, when taken in context, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is granted.
