KEYWORD: Drugs 

DIGEST: Applicant’s use and purchase of illegal drugs that include marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy has not been mitigated.  His illegal drug use, which he intended to stop after graduating from college, continued after college, and until he was hired by his employer.  This issue calls into question his credibility.  More importantly, the record is void of sufficient mitigation to demonstrate a commitment to a drug free lifestyle.  Clearance is denied.
