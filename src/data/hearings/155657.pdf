KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant has six delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling approximately $76,080. Although he initially claimed that three of the accounts had been resolved, as of the date he responded to the File of Relevant Material, he had not submitted documentary evidence to show that he had resolved any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. Instead of attempting to resolve the accounts, he has relied on the argument that some of the accounts were charged off or they are no longer in his most recent credit report. With a substantial annual income of $115,336, it appears that he has been unwilling to satisfy his debts, even those of less than $300, regardless of an ability to do so. His actions/inaction under the circumstances continue to cast substantial doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied.
