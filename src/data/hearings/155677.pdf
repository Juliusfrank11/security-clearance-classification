KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. As of the date the Statement of Reasons was issued in September 2020, none of those income tax returns had been filed. It was not until nearly two months later, that he filed those income tax returns. He claimed that depression and anxiety afflicted his ability to take timely action, and that confusion after the initial delay took place, kept him from resolving the issues for several years following the first failure. Applicant’s actions or inaction continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied.
