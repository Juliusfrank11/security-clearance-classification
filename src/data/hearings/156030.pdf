KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant had 20 delinquent Statement of Reasons (SOR)-alleged accounts totaling approximately $84,055, as well as a number of delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. His financial problems arose when he was injured two times, one year apart, in work-related incidents while serving as a security officer. He had previously been placed on the temporary disability retired list and honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy. In October 2016 – approximately three and one-quarter years before the SOR was issued, he enrolled in a debt-resolution program, and he has been making monthly payments of $847.88 since that time. Some accounts, both SOR-related and others, have been settled, and others are in the process of being resolved. Applicant’s actions no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is granted.
