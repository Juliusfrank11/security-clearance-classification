KEYWORD: Financial         
			 
DIGEST: Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts over a number of years, attributable in part to child and spousal support obligations imposed on him in his divorce decree. Without an established track record of addressing his debts, it is still too soon to make safe predictions that he will be able to restore her finances to levels consistent with requirements for holding a security clearance. Financial concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility to hold a security clearance is denied.
