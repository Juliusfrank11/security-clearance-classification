KEYWORD: Foreign Influence
DIGEST: Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth who has parents and a close friend who are citizens and residents of South Korea. Although South Korea presents some heightened risks due to its historical record of being a major collector of classified and proprietary information, Applicant carried her evidentiary burden of demonstrating that in the event of a confrontation with South Korean government officials over obtaining classified or sensitive information from Applicant, she would prioritize U.S. security interests over any potentially conflicting private interests.  Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted.
