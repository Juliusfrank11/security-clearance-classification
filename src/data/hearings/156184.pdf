KEYWORD: Alcohol Consumption; Drug Involvement 

DIGEST: Applicant has three driving while intoxicated (DWI) arrests (2008, 2012, and 2018) and was convicted of the last two DWIs. Additionally, he was convicted in 2007 of simple possession of a Schedule II Controlled Substance, and he illegally used marijuana between 2007 and 2017. Without additional current evidence of rehabilitation, a pattern of abstinence, disassociation, and a changed lifestyle, the passage of time alone is insufficient to mitigate the alcohol consumption and substance abuse security concerns. Clearance is denied.
