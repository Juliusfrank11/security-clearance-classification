KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant had two Chapter 7 bankruptcies (October 2010 and May 2019) that resulted in most of his liabilities being discharged, as well as seven Chapter 13 bankruptcies between December 2010 and January 2016 that were eventually dismissed. He acknowledged that he had over-extended himself financially by charging his travel, clothing, jewelry, and dining out on his credit cards to the point where they became “maxed out,” and did not think he would be able to pay his debts, so he filed for bankruptcy. Between August 2015 and April 2019, he took several international trips. Based on his own description of events, it appears that while he may have at several points had an inability to satisfy at least some of his debts, there were also times when he had the ability to satisfy some of his debts, but chose not to do so in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. He made no assertions, and offered no documentation, to support any conclusion that he paid any of his creditors, directly or through the bankruptcy Trustee. Applicant’s actions continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied.
