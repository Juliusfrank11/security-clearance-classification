He is currently on two years of deferred adjudication with community supervision for a December 2018 drug possession charge, and the disposition of a December 2018 drunk-driving charge is unclear. Reform was not sufficiently established of either the drug involvement and substance misuse or the alcohol consumption security concerns. Clearance eligibility is denied.
