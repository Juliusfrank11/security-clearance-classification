KEYWORD: Financial         
			 
DIGEST: Applicant accumulated four delinquent student loan debts over a number of years, attributable in part to unspecified unemployment and under employment. Without a seasonable record of payments in accordance with the terms of her loan consolidation, it is still too soon to make safe predictions that she will be able to restore her finances to levels consistent with requirements for holding a security clearance.  Financial concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility to hold a security clearance is denied.
