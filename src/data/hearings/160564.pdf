KEYWORD: Personal Conduct; Criminal Conduct

DIGEST: Applicant falsely claimed 1,035 in work hours not performed from October 1, 2015 through January 22, 2016. He is remorseful for his fraudulent conduct, but it continues to cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns because of his submissions of falsified work records are not mitigated. Criminal conduct security concerns raised by his arrests for assault and battery in December 2004 and June 2007, on an outstanding bench warrant in July 2010, and operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OUI) in July 2013, are mitigated. Clearance eligibility is denied.
