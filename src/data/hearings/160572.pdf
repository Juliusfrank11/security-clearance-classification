KEYWORD: Foreign Influence

DIGEST: Applicant provided financial support for several years to three female resident citizens of the Philippines, whom he met online, initially seeking romance. He has never met them in person, but continues to send $300 per month each to two of the women. While he regards his support as charity, these foreign ties present a heightened risk of undue foreign influence. Clearance eligibility is denied.
