KEYWORD: Personal Conduct  
			 
DIGEST: Applicant incurred a number of traffic-related arrests and charges over an extended period between 2007 and 2018 (comprised of multiple charges of driving on a suspended license and driving without insurance or registration), as well as a more recent domestic-assault charge, that together reflect a pattern of judgment lapses indicative of reckless disregard of applicable rules and regulations. Without an established track record of compliance, it is still too soon to make safe predictions that she will be able to restore her demonstrated respect for rules and regulations to levels consistent with requirements for holding a security clearance. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility to hold a security clearance is denied.
