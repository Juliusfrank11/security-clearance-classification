KEYWORD: Financial; Personal Conduct

DIGEST: Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2017, and he defaulted on his federal student loans, a credit card, and some cellphone and utility debts after a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. He has paid his past-due state taxes and some other debts. He obtained a consolidation of his student loans and filed his delinquent income tax returns. Yet concerns persist about his financial judgment. The personal conduct security concerns raised by his deliberate concealment of his tax issues from his September 2017 security clearance application are also not adequately mitigated. Clearance eligibility is denied.
