KEYWORD: Financial

DIGEST: Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2019. His filing in March 2021 of his delinquent federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019 does not fully mitigate the concerns for his judgment raised by his noncompliance with his tax-filing obligations for several years. Clearance eligibility is denied.
