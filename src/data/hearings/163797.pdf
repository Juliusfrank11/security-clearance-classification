KEYWORD:  Finances

DIGEST: Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2017 and 2018. As of April 24, 2020, the date the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued, none of those income tax returns had yet been filed. In fact, Applicant has conceded that they were not filed until April 27th, April 28th, or April 29th, 2020, nearly two years after she was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant’s actions, or inaction, cast substantial doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility for a position of public trust is denied.
