DIGEST: Applicant’s social anxiety and unemployment for six months in 2016 and 2017 is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate not filing federal and state tax returns for at least 10 years. Even though she settled a large commercial debt in May 2021, the financial considerations guideline is unmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
