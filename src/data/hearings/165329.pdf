KEYWORD: Drugs
DIGEST: Applicant was involved in multiple drug use, purchases, and sales while in college. Since graduating from college with a degree in electrical engineering and moving home to live with his parents, he has abstained from illegal and non-prescribed prescription drugs for over two years. He has since discontinued his past associations with his college friends and contacts who used illegal drugs and purchased and sold drugs from and to Applicant, respectively. More time is needed, however, to fully absolve him from recurrence risks. Drug involvement concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied.
