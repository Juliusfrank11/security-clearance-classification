KEYWORD: Foreign Influence

DIGEST: Applicant’s parents and two siblings are resident-citizens of Iraq and they could make him vulnerable to pressure or coercion. Notwithstanding his wife and one sister being permanent U.S. residents, he failed to establish that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign person or entity and the interest of the United States. He has deep loyalties and a sense of obligation for his family in Iraq. Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
