DIGEST: The alleged SOR debts are not the product of irresponsible financial behavior, but a failed business venture by Applicant’s wife. Neither the origination of these debts nor Applicant’s efforts to resolve them make him vulnerable to coercion or exploitation. Furthermore, these debts do not otherwise raise doubts about his ongoing security worthiness. Clearance is granted.
