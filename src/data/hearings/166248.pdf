KEYWORD: Foreign Influence, Personal Conduct

DIGEST: Applicant’s wife and three adult children are dual U.S.-Russian citizens, as is Applicant himself. His elderly father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant and his family continue to own a small apartment in Russia. He and his wife have bank accounts in Russia through which they receive monthly benefits from the Russian government. Applicant’s wife uses her benefits to support her elderly father. Given the strong heightened risk shown by the Russian government’s relationship with the United States and with the Russian people, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. The personal conduct allegations under Guideline E are either mitigated or not established. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
