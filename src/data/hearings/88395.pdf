KEYWORD:  Financial

DIGEST: Applicant is an honorably discharged U.S. Navy veteran who served on deployments to the Middle-East, and later as a civilian employee, served in Afghanistan. He had eight delinquent Statement of Reasons (SOR), totaling approximately $25,711. Although he initially claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a current status, he indicated in July 2018, that he was willing and able to resolve his delinquent debts. As of the date the record closed in December 2020, he had not resolved any of them. Moreover, other than Applicant’s unverified contentions regarding his efforts to resolve a family loan, he admitted that he had not engaged any of his creditors in a dialogue to establish a repayment plan or that he had made any payments. Applicant’s actions continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied.
